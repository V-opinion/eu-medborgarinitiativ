      <h1>The 2024 EU Elections, Ukraine, and the Unfinished Project of European Democracy</h1>

      <p><strong>The 2024 European Parliament elections raise a sharp and uncomfortable question:</strong> did voters really give EU parliamentarians a mandate to focus almost exclusively on Ukraine, a country that is not a member of the Union and whose citizens had no right to vote in those elections?</p>

      <p>This question is not about supporting or abandoning Ukraine. It is about democratic legitimacy, priorities, and who has the right to decide.</p>

      <h2>A “Ukraine-only” mandate that no one voted on</h2>

      <p>European elections are formally about the entire EU agenda: economy, climate, social policy, migration, foreign affairs, fundamental rights. Ukraine is clearly a central issue for this term. But:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ukraine is not an EU member.</li>
        <li>Ukrainian citizens did not vote in the 2024 European Parliament elections.</li>
        <li>No ballot asked: “Should the EU focus mainly on Ukraine?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When political leaders, media, and institutions act as if the Union’s main task is Ukraine, many citizens feel a gap between their daily concerns and the agenda in Brussels and Strasbourg. They voted on many issues. Yet they see one non‑member state dominating debate, budgets, and diplomacy.</p>

      <p>The question is not whether Ukraine matters. It does. The question is whether <strong>European citizens ever explicitly authorized a “Ukraine‑first” or “Ukraine‑only” EU</strong>, and what democratic instruments exist when people disagree with that direction.</p>

      <h2>Referendums on Swexit and the EU’s mission</h2>

      <p>This is where referendums enter the discussion.</p>

      <p><strong>1. A referendum on Swexit</strong><br>
      In Sweden, some argue that if the EU is moving towards a more geopolitical, security‑driven union without direct popular consent, then citizens should be given a clear choice: remain or leave. A Swexit referendum would force an honest debate about what kind of EU Swedes want.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Referendums in all EU countries on the EU’s scope</strong><br>
      Beyond membership, there is a deeper question:<br>
      – Should the EU be allowed to concentrate its political energy and financial resources on Ukraine?<br>
      – Or should its mandate be more narrowly defined and periodically confirmed by citizens?</p>

      <p>Pan‑European or national referendums on the Union’s priorities could:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Re‑anchor EU policy in explicit popular consent.</li>
        <li>Clarify whether citizens support a “geopolitical Commission” and a strong external‑action Union,</li>
        <li>Or prefer a more limited, inward‑focused EU.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Without such mechanisms, there is a risk that strategic choices are made by elites, rubber‑stamped by elections that were never framed as referendums on Ukraine, and then treated as if they carried a precise mandate that was never clearly given.</p>

      <h2>Religious parties and the secular foundations of the EU</h2>

      <p>At the same time, democracy in Europe faces another, deeper challenge: the role of religion in politics.</p>

      <p>In many EU countries, parties rooted mainly in Christian traditions still shape policies on migration, family, education, and foreign affairs. In the European Parliament, <strong>religiously inspired or culturally Christian parties</strong> can be elected almost exclusively by Christian voters, yet help decide laws that affect people of all faiths and none.</p>

      <p>The concern is not that believers are active in politics. That is their right. The concern is that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>separation between state and church</strong>, and</li>
        <li>The <strong>separation between religion and politics</strong>,</li>
      </ul>

      <p>are eroded when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The EU drifts toward identity‑based politics where “Christian Europe” is invoked against other religions and minorities,</li>
        <li>Religious narratives influence policy without robust secular, rights‑based checks and balances.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If democracy is what granted all religions freedom, then democracy must also <strong>limit the power of any single religion to dominate public institutions</strong>. EU democracy must ensure that laws are grounded in universal human rights, not in any one scripture.</p>

      <h2>An incomplete democracy: Sweden as a warning and a mirror</h2>

      <p>The EU often sees itself as a model of democracy. Sweden, too, is proud of its democratic history. But history reveals how slow real inclusion can be.</p>

      <p>Swedish women gained the right to vote in 1921. It took more than 100 years before Sweden elected its first woman as prime minister.</p>

      <p>The formal right existed for a century before power at the very top changed hands. Structures, party cultures, and social norms held back full equality long after the law changed.</p>

      <p>Now, we must ask a new question:</p>

      <p><strong>How many hundreds of years will it take before someone with an immigrant background becomes prime minister of Sweden?</strong></p>

      <p>People of immigrant background in Sweden vote, pay taxes, and contribute to society. They are present in local councils and, to some extent, in the national parliament. Yet they remain almost invisible in the highest leadership positions.</p>

      <h2>Democracy in the EU must develop – not stand still</h2>

      <p>Across these issues – Ukraine, Swexit, religious parties, and representation – the same message appears: democracy is not finished. The EU’s current structure is not the end of history.</p>

      <p>To move forward, the Union and its member states should:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarify mandates</strong> – via referendums, citizens’ assemblies, and open debate, specify what citizens really want from the EU.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect secular, rights‑based governance</strong> – ensure no religious identity can dominate EU institutions or law.</li>
        <li><strong>Accelerate inclusion in political leadership</strong> – make it a priority that women, minorities, and people with immigrant backgrounds are visible at the very top.</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledge the democratic deficit in external focus</strong> – openly debate and legitimize the scale of EU’s engagement with non‑member states like Ukraine.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If Europe wants to remain a credible defender of democracy, at home and abroad, it must dare to confront these questions – and accept that <strong>democracy within the EU must continue to develop, or it will slowly lose its meaning.</strong></p>
