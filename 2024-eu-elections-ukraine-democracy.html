The 2024 EU elections, Ukraine, and the unfinished project of European democracy

The 2024 European Parliament elections raise a sharp and uncomfortable question: did voters really give EU parliamentarians a mandate to focus almost exclusively on Ukraine, a country that is not a member of the Union and whose citizens had no right to vote in those elections?

This question is not about supporting or abandoning Ukraine. It is about democratic legitimacy, priorities, and who has the right to decide.
A “Ukraine-only” mandate that no one voted on

European elections are formally about the entire EU agenda: economy, climate, social policy, migration, foreign affairs, fundamental rights. Ukraine is clearly a central issue for this term. But:

    Ukraine is not an EU member.

    Ukrainian citizens did not vote in the 2024 European Parliament elections.

    No ballot asked: “Should the EU focus mainly on Ukraine?”

When political leaders, media, and institutions act as if the Union’s main task is Ukraine, many citizens feel a gap between their daily concerns and the agenda in Brussels and Strasbourg. They voted on many issues. Yet they see one non‑member state dominating debate, budgets, and diplomacy.

The question is not whether Ukraine matters. It does. The question is whether European citizens ever explicitly authorized a “Ukraine‑first” or “Ukraine‑only” EU, and what democratic instruments exist when people disagree with that direction.
Referendums on Swexit and the EU’s mission

This is where referendums enter the discussion.

    A referendum on Swexit
    In Sweden, some argue that if the EU is moving towards a more geopolitical, security‑driven union without direct popular consent, then citizens should be given a clear choice: remain or leave. A Swexit referendum would force an honest debate about what kind of EU Swedes want.

    Referendums in all EU countries on the EU’s scope
    Beyond membership, there is a deeper question:

        Should the EU be allowed to concentrate its political energy and financial resources on Ukraine?

        Or should its mandate be more narrowly defined and periodically confirmed by citizens?

Pan‑European or national referendums on the Union’s priorities could:

    Re‑anchor EU policy in explicit popular consent.

    Clarify whether citizens support a “geopolitical Commission” and a strong external‑action Union,

    Or prefer a more limited, inward‑focused EU.

Without such mechanisms, there is a risk that strategic choices are made by elites, rubber‑stamped by elections that were never framed as referendums on Ukraine, and then treated as if they carried a precise mandate that was never clearly given.
Religious parties and the secular foundations of the EU

At the same time, democracy in Europe faces another, deeper challenge: the role of religion in politics.

In many EU countries, parties rooted mainly in Christian traditions still shape policies on migration, family, education, and foreign affairs. In the European Parliament, religiously inspired or culturally Christian parties can be elected almost exclusively by Christian voters, yet help decide laws that affect people of all faiths and none.

The concern is not that believers are active in politics. That is their right. The concern is that:

    The separation between state and church, and

    The separation between religion and politics,

are eroded when:

    The EU drifts toward identity‑based politics where “Christian Europe” is invoked against other religions and minorities,

    Religious narratives influence policy without robust secular, rights‑based checks and balances.

If democracy is what granted all religions freedom, then democracy must also limit the power of any single religion to dominate public institutions. EU democracy must ensure that laws are grounded in universal human rights, not in any one scripture.

This requires:

    Strict institutional secularism at EU level.

    Equal respect for all faiths and for non‑belief.

    Critical debate on whether it is healthy that some parties effectively represent mostly one religious group while governing a pluralist Union.

An incomplete democracy: Sweden as a warning and a mirror

The EU often sees itself as a model of democracy. Sweden, too, is proud of its democratic history. But history reveals how slow real inclusion can be.

    Swedish women gained the right to vote in 1921.

    It took more than 100 years before Sweden elected its first woman as prime minister.

The formal right existed for a century before power at the very top changed hands. Structures, party cultures, and social norms held back full equality long after the law changed.

Now, we must ask a new question:

How many hundreds of years will it take before someone with an immigrant background becomes prime minister of Sweden?

People of immigrant background in Sweden:

    Vote, pay taxes, and contribute to society.

    Are present in local councils and, to some extent, in the national parliament.

    Are part of the social and economic fabric of the country.

Yet they remain almost invisible in the highest leadership positions. The pattern is familiar:

    First, formal rights are granted.

    Then, slowly and painfully, representation catches up – sometimes a century later.

If Sweden, one of the world’s oldest democracies, still struggles to reflect its true population in top leadership, what does that say about the EU’s claim to be a fully mature democracy?
Democracy in the EU must develop – not stand still

Across these issues – Ukraine, Swexit, religious parties, and representation – the same message appears:

    Democracy is not finished.

    The EU’s current structure is not the end of history.

To move forward, the Union and its member states should:

    Clarify mandates

        Use referendums, citizens’ assemblies, and open debate to specify what citizens really want from the EU: a narrow market union, a geopolitical power, or something in between.

    Protect secular, rights‑based governance

        Ensure that no religious identity – Christian or otherwise – can dominate EU institutions or law.

        Safeguard the separation of state and church, and of religion and politics.

    Accelerate inclusion in political leadership

        Make it a priority that women, minorities, and people with immigrant backgrounds are not just voters and backbenchers, but ministers, party leaders, and prime ministers.

        Reform party structures and selection processes that still reproduce old elites.

    Acknowledge the democratic deficit in external focus

        When the EU devotes immense resources and political energy to a non‑member state whose citizens cannot vote in EU elections, this must be openly debated and legitimized, not silently assumed.

The 2024 EU elections did not ask voters for a “Ukraine‑only” mandate. They did not ask Swedes or other Europeans whether they accept a Union largely shaped by religiously rooted parties. They did not ask how long citizens are willing to wait for real inclusion at the top.

If Europe wants to remain a credible defender of democracy, at home and abroad, it must dare to confront these questions – and accept that democracy within the EU must continue to develop, or it will slowly lose its meaning.




Solving the Israel–Palestine conflict is not about one “magic formula,” but about building political, social, and religious structures that make coexistence more attractive and more legitimate than violence. Your idea – a Multi‑Religion Election System and a Faith Representatives Chamber – is one such structural proposal. Below I’ll first answer your historical questions, then connect them to your model and show how it could fit into a broader peace architecture.
1. Why is the Israel–Palestine conflict so hard to solve?

Several layers of conflict overlap:

    Land and sovereignty: Who controls which territory, where borders run, what happens to refugees, Jerusalem, settlements, security, etc.

    Identity and history: Competing historical narratives of suffering, exile, and victimhood – the Holocaust, the Nakba, wars, terrorism, occupation.

    Religion and the sacred: Holy sites and religious claims in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.

    Regional and global politics: Neighboring states, great powers, rival blocs, and proxy dynamics.

Any solution must:

    Provide fair, realistic security and freedom for both Israelis and Palestinians.

    Be seen as legitimate by the populations, not just elites.

    Contain radical spoilers (on both sides) who prefer “no peace” to “bad peace” in their eyes.

This is where your emphasis on democracy within religious communities and on multi‑faith structures becomes relevant: it is about managing spoilers and building legitimacy in a religiously charged conflict.
2. Why was Yitzhak Rabin assassinated – and what is special about it?

Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli extremist opposed to the Oslo peace process. The assassin believed Rabin was “betraying” the Jewish people and endangering Israel by giving land and recognition to the Palestinians. In his mind, peace itself was treason.

This matters for three reasons:

    It was an internal attack from the “own” side.

        The killer was not a Palestinian militant; he was a Jewish Israeli, religiously motivated, claiming to defend his own nation and faith.

    It targeted a peace process, not just a leader.

        Assassinating a leader is always tragic, but here the purpose was to kill a specific political direction: coexistence based on compromise.

    It highlighted the power of religious and ideological extremism to block democratic choices.

        Many Israelis had voted for parties that supported negotiations.

        Yet one extremist with a gun could try to overrule that collective decision.

You ask whether this is different from the assassinations of Kennedy and Palme.

    Kennedy was killed in a Cold War, civil‑rights, and conspiracy‑laden context; motives are debated, but it was not clearly to stop a specific peace agreement with a defined enemy.

    Olof Palme was a strong critic of apartheid, the Vietnam War, and injustice worldwide; his assassination was also highly political, but again, not clearly tied to a specific bilateral peace accord like Oslo.

Rabin’s assassination is unique because:

    It directly targeted a concrete, active peace process between two peoples in a long national conflict.

    It was rooted in a mix of nationalist and religious radicalism that rejected any territorial compromise as blasphemy.

This shows how religion + nationalism, when captured by extremists, can override democratic mandates and sabotage peace. That is exactly the problem your Multi‑Religion Election System tries to address.
3. Your principle: democracy gave freedom of religion – now democracy must enter religion

You propose a powerful starting point:

    “We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception.”

This flips the usual logic. Normally states say:
“We guarantee freedom of religion; in exchange, religions agree to respect democratic law.”

You add another step:

    If religions benefit from democracy, they themselves must become more democratic internally.

    That means:

        Transparent elections of leaders.

        Representation of different currents within a faith.

        Accountability to members, not just to sacred texts interpreted by a small elite.

In deeply religious societies or conflicts like Israel–Palestine, this idea could be transformative:

    Instead of unelected, unaccountable religious authorities deciding war/peace attitudes, faith representatives would be chosen democratically by believers.

    This might reduce the gap between:

        Ordinary believers who want safety, dignity, and coexistence.

        Hardline religious leaders who benefit from perpetual tension.

4. From Church Elections to a Multi‑Religion Election System

You propose:

    In countries that already have church elections (like the Church of Sweden):

        Transition from single‑church elections to Multi‑Religion Elections.

        Instead of one dominant church having formal elections, all recognized faiths participate in a joint electoral framework.

    In countries without such elections (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel, etc.):

        Introduce a Multi‑Religion Election System from scratch.

The goal: replace or complement existing religious governance systems with a democratic, multi‑faith framework.

Key features as you describe them:

    Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) – Trosrepresentanternas kammare

        Independent from political parties and politicians.

        Replaces church‑specific bodies like the General Synod.

        Becomes the highest representative body of all faiths in the country or region.

        Members are elected in Multi‑Faith (Multi‑Religion) Elections.

    Multi‑Religion Elections

        The practical application of the Multi‑Religion Election System.

        Believers from all religions vote for their faith representatives.

        Rules are equal and transparent across religions.

    Multi‑Religion Support – new financial model

        Replaces religious/faith funding like the Swedish SST Foundation and similar party‑style support.

        Crucially, independent of tax revenue, so:

            The state does not “control” faiths through funding.

            Faith communities have predictable, fair, and transparent support mechanisms.

If implemented seriously, this would create:

    A democratic “parliament of religions” (FRC).

    Less state favoritism for a single “national church” or dominant faith.

    An institutional channel where religious voices can talk to each other and to the state outside of party politics.

5. Applying your idea to the Israel–Palestine conflict

Now, how could this help with one of the world’s most difficult conflicts?
5.1. The core problem: religious legitimacy for peace

Even when political leaders reach agreements (like the Oslo Accords), religious legitimacy is often missing or contested:

    Some rabbis or imams declare compromise forbidden or sinful.

    Extremist groups claim God requires total victory, not coexistence.

    Ordinary believers are caught between their desire for peace and fear of betraying their faith.

If there were a democratically elected Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) in Israel and in Palestine, or even a joint or parallel structure, it could:

    Make visible how many believers actually support peace and coexistence.

    Reduce the power of small, radical religious elites who speak “in the name of God” without a democratic mandate.

    Provide joint religious declarations that bless and legitimize compromise, ceasefires, and peace agreements.

5.2. Concrete possible roles of an FRC in such a conflict

In a country like Israel (and similarly on the Palestinian side, and regionally), an FRC could:

    Bring together:

        Jewish denominations (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, secular/traditional voices).

        Muslim leaders.

        Christian leaders.

        Druze, Baháʼí, and other minorities.

    Do, for example:

        Issue joint statements on the sanctity of life and condemnation of attacks on civilians, from all faiths together.

        Provide moral backing for political compromises (land swaps, shared or special status for Jerusalem, protection of holy sites under joint arrangements).

        Develop inter‑faith education guidelines to reduce hate and demonization in religious schools and sermons.

        Serve as a monitoring body against incitement within religious institutions.

Because the FRC is:

    Not a political party chamber,

    But also not a purely state‑appointed advisory council,

it can become a bridge between faith and democracy – giving peace policies religious credibility while keeping religious authorities answerable to believers in a democratic way.
6. Is this realistic? What would it take?

Your proposal is ambitious and controversial, especially in highly charged environments. For it to work, several conditions are needed:

    Legal recognition and protection

        States would need to recognize Multi‑Faith Elections and the FRC in law.

        At the same time, the FRC must stay independent of government control.

    Equal treatment of all faiths

        No “state religion” that dominates the FRC.

        Clear rules so majority faiths do not completely drown out smaller ones.

    Security and trust

        In conflict zones, faith representatives who support peace often risk their lives (as Rabin did, though he was a political leader).

        The system must protect those who stand for compromise.

    Gradual implementation

        Start in countries with relative stability and existing church elections (like Sweden).

        Prove that the model works: greater transparency, less radicalization, more dialogue.

        Use these successes as arguments to adapt and promote similar models in more conflict‑affected countries over time.

7. How this connects back to Rabin, Kennedy, and Palme

All three assassinations share something:

    Violent rejection of change by people who believed their worldview was under threat.

Rabin’s case adds a special religious‑democratic dimension:

    Oslo was a democratic choice by a large part of the Israeli electorate.

    A religious‑nationalist extremist tried to overrule that choice with a bullet, claiming a higher, sacred authority.

Your model – democracy inside religion and a multi‑faith democratic chamber – is an answer to that problem:

    It says:
    “If you claim to speak for God and the faithful, you must first be chosen in a fair, open, democratic way by those very faithful.”

    It reduces the space for lone extremists or tiny radical factions to act as if they represent an entire religion.

In that sense, your proposal is not just administrative. It is a deep philosophical and political attempt to align:

    Religious authority

    Democratic legitimacy

    And peaceful coexistence

so that peace agreements like Oslo do not hang on a few fragile individuals but are rooted in broad, democratic, multi‑faith support.
8. Next steps you could take with your idea

To move from concept to influence, you might:

    Write a clear, structured manifesto in English:

        Short intro on Israel–Palestine and Rabin.

        Explanation of why democracy must enter religion.

        Detailed description of:

            Multi‑Religion Election System

            Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC)

            Multi‑Religion Support (financial model)

        A section on how this could apply in Sweden, Israel/Palestine, and globally.

    Engage with think tanks and faith‑based institutes

        Especially those working on inter‑faith dialogue, democracy, and peacebuilding.

        Present your model as one possible institutional innovation for deeply religious conflicts.

    Pilot discussion in Sweden

        Sweden is peaceful and already has church elections.

        It could be a test case: shift from single‑church elections toward a multi‑religion framework.

        If it works there, it becomes easier to argue for it in more difficult places.

If you share the draft text you want to use on multireligionvalsystem.eu.org, I can help you:

    Turn it into a polished English manifesto,

    Or into a shorter policy paper you can send to Swedish and international think tanks, peace institutes, and faith leaders.

Title: Democratizing Religion to Strengthen Peace and Democracy
A Policy Proposal for Sweden, Europe, and Global Conflict Contexts

1. Background: Democracy, Religion, and Blocked Peace

Modern democracy has granted all religious communities freedom of religion. Yet, in many countries, religion itself remains internally undemocratic and sometimes captured by narrow, unelected elites. This gap is dangerous: religious authority can be used to undermine democratic mandates, block peace processes, and fuel extremism.

A striking example is the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yitzhak Rabin. He was murdered by an Israeli extremist who opposed the Oslo Accords – a peace process supported by many Israeli voters. His killer claimed to defend religion and nation against compromise.

This pattern is not unique to Israel–Palestine. The assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Olof Palme also show how violent actors can try to overturn democratic directions. But Rabin’s case is especially revealing because it highlights how religious and nationalist extremism can overrule a legitimate, democratic decision for peace.

If religious freedom is guaranteed by democracy, then democracy must, in turn, enter religion. Religious communities must be encouraged – and enabled – to organize themselves democratically, so that no small, radical minority can claim to speak for “God” or “the faithful” against the broader will of believers and citizens.
2. Core Principle

We start from two simple, connected principles:

    Democracy grants freedom of religion.
    Democratic systems protect the right of all faiths and non‑believers to exist, organize, and practice.

    Therefore, democracy should be introduced within all religions, without exception.
    Religious leadership and representation should be chosen in democratic, transparent ways by their own members, not only by appointment, inheritance, or closed hierarchies.

This internal democratization of religion is not about theology; it is about representation, accountability, and coexistence. It aims to reduce the risk that religious authority becomes a tool for anti‑democratic or violent agendas.
3. The Multi‑Religion Election System

To put this principle into practice, we propose the Multi‑Religion Election System. It has three main components:

    Multi‑Religion Elections

    Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC)

    Multi‑Religion Support (new financial model)

These components can be adapted to different constitutional and cultural contexts, but the core logic is the same: equal, democratic rules for all recognized faiths; independence from party politics; and transparent, non‑coercive financial support.
3.1 Multi‑Religion Elections

Multi‑Religion Elections are the practical implementation of the Multi‑Religion Election System. They are designed to:

    Allow members of all recognized religions to vote for their own faith representatives.

    Apply common, transparent rules to all faiths (registration, candidate eligibility, terms, oversight).

    Replace or complement existing church‑only elections with an inclusive, multi‑faith structure.

In countries that already have church elections (for example, Sweden’s Church elections), these can be gradually transformed into Multi‑Religion Elections. Instead of only one dominant church having a formal electoral process, all faith communities participate under the same democratic framework.

In countries without such elections (e.g. USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel, and others), Multi‑Religion Elections can be introduced as a new institution, adapted to each legal system.
3.2 Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC)

At the center of this system stands the Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) – in Swedish, Trosrepresentanternas kammare.

Key characteristics:

    Independent of political parties and politicians.
    The FRC is not a second parliament of party politics, but a chamber of religious representation.

    Highest representative body of all faiths.
    It replaces mono‑religious bodies such as a single General Synod, and becomes a common platform for all recognized religions.

    Elected in Multi‑Faith (Multi‑Religion) Elections.
    Members are chosen by believers, faith community by faith community, according to shared democratic rules.

Functions may include:

    Dialogue between religions on issues of peace, coexistence, education, and ethics.

    Advisory opinions to governments and parliaments on laws affecting religion and freedom of belief.

    Joint declarations condemning violence, extremism, and hate speech in the name of religion.

    Support for inter‑faith understanding in schools, media, and public life.

The FRC does not legislate; it does not replace parliaments. Its role is to give democratically grounded, plural religious voices a structured role in public debate, without granting any single faith privileged state power.
3.3 Multi‑Religion Support – A New Financial Model

Today, in some countries, religious communities receive financial support through mechanisms like special state foundations or arrangements similar to public party funding. These systems can:

    Favour one “national church” over others.

    Tie religious financing too closely to tax revenue and politics.

    Lack transparency and equality among different faiths.

We propose Multi‑Religion Support, a reformed financial model that:

    Replaces institution‑specific schemes like the SST Foundation in Sweden and similar models elsewhere.

    Is designed for all participating faith communities under equal principles.

    Operates independently of tax revenue, relying instead on a mix of:

        Member contributions.

        Transparent state support not controlled by political parties.

        Possibly matching funds or neutral distribution formulas.

The goal is to ensure that religious communities have stable, fair support without becoming financial clients of any political party or government.
4. Why This Matters for Peace and Democracy

The Multi‑Religion Election System and the FRC directly address a central problem in many conflicts:

    Democratic decisions for compromise or peace are often undermined by religious or ideological extremists who claim divine authority but have no democratic mandate from the broader faith community.

By democratizing religious representation:

    Believers can choose who speaks for them in public debates about peace, justice, and coexistence.

    Radicals lose the ability to act as if they are “the voice of religion” when they are, in fact, only a small minority.

    Governments, parliaments, and international actors can engage with a legitimate, plural, and accountable religious interlocutor.

This has implications for:

    Longstanding conflicts such as Israel–Palestine, where religion and identity are deeply intertwined with politics and territory.

    Stable democracies like Sweden, which can pioneer multi‑religion models in a peaceful context and serve as examples for others.

    Multireligious and multiethnic societies worldwide facing rising polarization and identity politics.

5. Proposed Next Steps for Think Tanks, Peace Institutes, and Faith Leaders

We invite Swedish and international think tanks, peace institutes, and faith leaders to:

    Study and refine the concept.

        Assess legal, constitutional, and practical options for piloting a Multi‑Religion Election System and establishing an FRC.

        Compare existing models of church elections, inter‑faith councils, and state–religion relations.

    Develop pilot projects.

        Sweden, with existing church elections and a strong democratic culture, is an ideal candidate for a first pilot.

        Lessons from Sweden and similar countries can inform future adaptations in more conflict‑affected contexts.

    Host dialogues and consultations.

        Bring together representatives of different faiths, secular organizations, legal experts, and policymakers to discuss the idea.

        Explore how democratized religious representation could support peace processes and prevent extremist vetoes.

    Integrate the idea into peacebuilding strategies.

        In conflict analysis and peace proposals, include the question:
        “How are religious authorities chosen, and how can they be made more democratic and accountable to their believers?”

6. Conclusion

Democracy has given religions freedom. It is time for religions to accept democracy in return – not in theology, but in representation and responsibility.

By building Multi‑Religion Elections, a Faith Representatives Chamber, and Multi‑Religion Support, societies can:

    Protect freedom of religion for all.

    Reduce the power of unelected, radical religious elites to sabotage peace.

    Strengthen both national and global efforts to resolve complex and controversial conflicts, including the Israel–Palestine conflict.

We present this proposal as a starting point for serious discussion and joint development with institutions and leaders committed to democracy, peace, and genuine multi‑faith coexistence.
