        <h1>The Israel–Palestine Conflict and the Legacy of the Oslo Accords</h1>
        <p>
            The Israel–Palestine conflict has become a symbol of protracted, seemingly unsolvable violence.
            For a brief period in the 1990s, the <strong>Oslo Accords</strong> created real hope for a negotiated peace.
            That hope was badly damaged when Israeli Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate
            <strong>Yitzhak Rabin</strong> was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to the peace process.

        <h2>Background: A Long and Deeply Rooted Conflict</h2>
        <p>
            The modern phase of the Israel–Palestine conflict began in the early 20th century, with overlapping
            Jewish and Arab national movements in historic Palestine under Ottoman and later British rule.
            The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians,
            and subsequent wars in 1948, 1967, and 1973 entrenched a cycle of violence, occupation, and mutual mistrust.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 1980s, the <strong>First Intifada</strong> – a Palestinian uprising against Israeli military rule
            in the occupied territories – signaled that the status quo was unsustainable. Both Israeli and Palestinian
            leaders came under pressure to find a political solution that would address security, self‑determination,
            and recognition.

        <h2>The Oslo Accords: A Framework for Peace</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Oslo Accords</strong>, negotiated secretly in Norway and signed in 1993 and 1995, were the first
            formal agreements between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
            They represented a historic mutual recognition:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Israel recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.</li>
            <li>The PLO recognized the State of Israel and renounced terrorism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The accords created the <strong>Palestinian Authority (PA)</strong> and laid out a phased process in which:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Israel would gradually withdraw from parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</li>
            <li>Palestinians would gain limited self‑governance in these areas.</li>
            <li>Final‑status issues – borders, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, and security – would be negotiated later.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For many Israelis and Palestinians, Oslo symbolized the possibility that a negotiated, two‑state solution
            could end the conflict and normalize relations.

        <h2>The Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin: A Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
            On 4 November 1995, Israeli Prime Minister <strong>Yitzhak Rabin</strong> was assassinated in Tel Aviv by
            <strong>Yigal Amir</strong>, a Jewish extremist who opposed the Oslo process and believed it betrayed religious
            and national claims to the land. Rabin, together with Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, had received the
            <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong> for his role in the peace efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            This act of political violence was more than the murder of a leader; it was an attempt to kill the peace
            process itself. The assassin’s goal was to stop territorial concessions and prevent the implementation of
            the Oslo Accords. In that sense, the peace framework was not only undermined by mistrust, violence, and
            failures on both sides, but also by <strong>Jewish extremist terrorism directed at the heart of the process</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Rabin’s assassination, Israeli politics shifted. Subsequent governments were more hesitant or openly
            opposed to key elements of Oslo, while continued settlement expansion, suicide bombings, and later
            military operations further eroded public support and trust on both sides.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="oslo-collapse">
        <h2>Did the Oslo Accords “Fail” – or Were They Undermined?</h2>
        <p>
            It is common to say that “Oslo failed.” A more accurate description is that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The accords contained structural weaknesses and ambiguities.</li>
            <li>They were never fully implemented as originally envisioned.</li>
            <li>They were systematically undermined by violence and political opposition on both sides.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On the Israeli side, extremist opponents of territorial compromise targeted the peace process through
            incitement and, in Rabin’s case, assassination. On the Palestinian side, militant groups carried out
            attacks that fueled fear and strengthened hardliners in Israel. Internationally, support for peace was
            often rhetorical but not backed by sufficient political pressure to address core issues such as
            settlements, borders, and Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saying that “the Oslo Accords were annulled by Jewish terrorists” reflects how decisive Rabin’s
            assassination and other acts of extremist violence were in derailing the political momentum.
            Legally, the accords were not formally revoked by a single act; politically, however, the assassination
            and subsequent policy choices deeply wounded the process and helped ensure that many of its promises
            were never realized.

    <section id="religion-politics">
        <h2>Religion, Politics, and the Weaponization of Faith</h2>
        <p>
            The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin also highlighted the dangerous intersection of religion and politics.
            The assassin justified his actions through a particular interpretation of Jewish religious and national
            duty. Similarly, the conflict is often framed, by extremists on all sides, as a holy struggle rather than
            a political dispute that can be negotiated.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not unique to one religion. Throughout the region and globally, political actors have invoked
            religious narratives to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Legitimize territorial claims.</li>
            <li>Demonize the “other” as an enemy of God.</li>
            <li>Mobilize support for maximalist, zero‑sum positions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When religious identities are fused with state power and territorial control, compromise can be portrayed
            as betrayal of faith rather than a political choice. This makes agreements like Oslo extremely fragile.
        </p>

    <section id="path-forward">
        <h2>What the Oslo Experience Teaches About Future Peace Efforts</h2>
        <p>
            The legacy of the Oslo Accords and Rabin’s assassination offers several lessons for any future attempt to
            resolve the Israel–Palestine conflict:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Peace processes must address extremists seriously.</strong><br>
                It is not enough to negotiate with official leaders. Governments and international actors must anticipate
                and actively counter those who will resort to incitement and violence to sabotage compromise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ambiguity can be deadly.</strong><br>
                Oslo left core issues for “later,” creating space for vastly different expectations. Any future framework
                needs clearer, enforceable timelines and mechanisms, including consequences for non‑compliance on all sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Religion cannot be ignored, but it must not be monopolized.</strong><br>
                Jewish, Muslim, and Christian identities are part of this conflict. The answer is not to erase religion,
                but to prevent any one religious narrative from claiming absolute political authority.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>International actors must move beyond symbolic support.</strong><br>
                The EU, UN, and other states cannot simply endorse peace “in principle.” They must align policies,
                including on settlements, human rights, and accountability for violence, with the stated goal of a
                just and lasting resolution.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion: Oslo’s Promise and its Betrayal</h2>
        <p>
            The Oslo Accords represented a rare moment when leaders on both sides – including Yitzhak Rabin,
            a former general, and Yasser Arafat, the long‑time head of the PLO – chose negotiation over perpetual war.
            The assassination of Rabin by a Jewish extremist was not only the killing of a prime minister and
            Nobel Peace Prize laureate; it was a direct attack on the very idea that compromise and coexistence
            are possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            While history cannot be reversed, its lessons can still shape the future. Recognizing how extremist
            violence, including Jewish extremist terrorism, helped derail the Oslo process is essential if we are
            to design more resilient, inclusive, and just frameworks for peace – frameworks that can withstand
            attacks from those who prefer endless conflict to negotiated coexistence.

     Why Do Christian Parties Sit In The European Parliament – And What Does That Mean For Everyone Else?</title>
    An analysis of Christian parties in the European Parliament, the incomplete separation between church and state, and why full secularism matters for equality and for resolving conflicts such as Israel–Palestine.">

            <h1>Why Do Christian Parties Sit In The European Parliament – And What Does That Mean For Everyone Else?</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p><strong>Across the European Union, Christian‑inspired political parties sit openly in the European Parliament.</strong> They are part of mainstream party families, shape legislation, and explicitly draw their values from Christianity.</p>
            <p>But there is no corresponding “Muslim party family,” “Jewish party family,” or organised Hindu or Buddhist group with comparable reach and institutional weight. This asymmetry is not accidental. It reveals something deeper: in Europe, <strong>the separation between state and church – and more broadly, between religion and politics – is incomplete and uneven.</strong></p>
            <p>This article explores why Christian parties exist at EU level, why this creates a structural exclusion of other religious citizens, and why moving toward a <strong>complete separation of religion and state</strong> is essential – including for resolving conflicts like the 77‑year‑long Israel–Palestine conflict so that it is not simply handed on to the next generation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. How Christian Parties Became “Normal” In European Politics</h2>
            <p><strong>Christian parties did not appear out of nowhere.</strong> They grew out of Europe’s historical reality: for centuries, Christianity (Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox) was the dominant religious and cultural force across the continent. Modern party systems emerged in that context.</p>
            <p>After World War II, Christian democratic parties became central actors in rebuilding Western Europe. They presented themselves as:</p>
            <p>Defenders of human dignity and social welfare, inspired by Christian ethics; anti‑totalitarian forces against both fascism and communism; and advocates of European integration as a peace project.</p>
            <p>Over time, many of these parties “softened” their explicit religious tone and started framing their agenda in more universal terms: human rights, social market economy, family policy, and so on. But:</p>
            <p>Their <strong>Christian identity remained historically and symbolically central</strong>; their <strong>organisational networks</strong> (churches, Christian associations, Christian trade unions) continued to shape their base; and at EU level, they organised into powerful party families with a Christian‑democratic label or clear Christian heritage.</p>
            <p>Because Christianity has been treated as the “default culture” of Europe, explicitly Christian parties came to be seen as <strong>normal</strong>, even for many secular citizens. That normalisation is exactly what hides the structural problem.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. The Hidden Asymmetry: Christian Representation vs. Everyone Else</h2>
            <p><strong>When Christian‑inspired parties are institutionally present and strong at EU level, but other religions have no comparable representation, a deep asymmetry emerges.</strong></p>
            <p>Christian citizens who want their religious convictions reflected politically have historic parties with long‑standing electoral brands, established access to EU‑level structures, and a “respectable” tradition in public life.</p>
            <p>By contrast, citizens belonging to other religions – Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, and non‑religious humanists – typically face:</p>
            <p>No established EU‑wide religious party families; social stigma or suspicion if they tried to build openly religious parties (“sectarian,” “divisive,” “extremist”); and legal and political systems that are formally secular but <strong>culturally tilted</strong> toward Christian references, making other religions appear “foreign” or “particularistic.”</p>
            <p>So the result is paradoxical:</p>
            <p>Christianity is allowed to be both “religion” and “culture,” giving it <strong>political legitimacy</strong>, while other religions are treated primarily as private beliefs or “minority issues,” not as legitimate bases for political organisation at the same scale.</p>
            <p>This creates a <strong>de facto exclusion policy</strong>: not through explicit bans, but through a system whose historic design privileges Christian‑based political actors, while implicitly discouraging or marginalising other religious voices.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Incomplete Separation Between State and Church – And Its Political Consequences</h2>
            <p>On paper, many EU member states claim neutrality or separation of state and church. But in practice, the separation is <strong>partial and selective</strong>.</p>
            <p>You see this in several ways: concordats and special legal statuses for Christian churches; public funding and official recognition for some churches and denominations, but not for all religions; symbolic references to Christianity in national constitutions, preambles, parliamentary ceremonies, and state events; and public holidays tied predominantly to Christian calendars.</p>
            <p>When political parties with Christian labels or Christian roots operate inside this environment, they are not simply “one interest group among many.” They are anchored in a <strong>broader system that already treats Christianity as more than just one private faith.</strong></p>
            <p>This is where the separation between state and church – and between religion and politics – is incomplete:</p>
            <p>The state often claims to be neutral, but <strong>its institutional memory, symbols, and party landscape are clearly shaped by one particular religion</strong>. That creates <strong>layered privileges</strong> for Christian citizens, even if many of them are personally secular or only culturally Christian, while other religious communities are told: you are welcome, but only if your religion remains largely invisible in the political sphere.</p>
            <p>The message is subtle but powerful: <strong>Christian religious identity can be political. Others must remain apolitical.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Why This Matters: Exclusion, Trust, And Democratic Legitimacy</h2>
            <p>Some might argue: “Anyone can start a party; nothing stops Muslims, Jews, or others from forming their own EU‑level parties.” Legally, that might be true in many countries. But <strong>democracy is not just about legal possibility; it is about realistic access and equal legitimacy.</strong></p>
            <p>When one religion has centuries of political participation, institutional support, and cultural legitimacy, and other religions are viewed with suspicion whenever they cross into political space, then the playing field is structurally uneven.</p>
            <p>This has several consequences:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Feelings of second‑class citizenship.</strong><br>
            Members of minority religions can reasonably feel that the political system recognises Christian identity as part of the public sphere but sees their identity as a private matter or even a threat.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Weak representation of certain concerns.</strong><br>
            Issues particularly affecting non‑Christian communities – discrimination, religious profiling, dress codes, burial rights, dietary rules, hate crimes, foreign policy positions linked to their regions of origin – may receive less sustained attention.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Erosion of trust in institutions.</strong><br>
            When people sense that the system is built around one religious tradition, they can start to see laws, police, courts, and parliaments as <em>serving a “majority religion” first</em>, even when individual officials try to be fair.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Reinforcing political polarisation.</strong><br>
            Excluded groups may withdraw from mainstream politics or turn to parallel structures and alternative networks that don't integrate with the wider society. That fuels mistrust on both sides.</p>
            <p>In a pluralistic Europe, this asymmetry undermines the <strong>democratic ideal that all citizens should stand equal before the state, regardless of religion.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Why Complete Separation Is So Important</h2>
            <p>A <strong>complete separation between state and church and between religion and politics</strong> does not mean persecuting religion or erasing it from society. It means:</p>
            <p>The state <strong>does not endorse, privilege, or institutionalise</strong> any religion; political representation is <strong>based on universal rights and interests</strong>, not on state‑sanctioned religious identities; and religious communities are free and protected in civil society, but <strong>not embedded in the formal architecture of the state or party system</strong>.</p>
            <p>Such a separation would have several benefits:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Equal dignity and visibility.</strong><br>
            If the state and political institutions are truly neutral, then Christianity no longer enjoys structural advantages over other religions. All communities meet as equals in the public sphere.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Fairer representation.</strong><br>
            Instead of religious parties representing only their own flock, political parties would be required to represent <strong>all citizens as citizens</strong>, grounding their programmes in human rights, social justice, and shared interests, not religious privilege.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Reduced identity competition.</strong><br>
            Once no religion can claim special status through the state, it becomes harder to justify exclusion or discrimination against others based on “our traditional religion.”</p>
            <p><strong>4. Stronger protection for freedom of religion and belief.</strong><br>
            When the state is fully neutral, it is better placed to protect both believers and non‑believers from coercion and discrimination.</p>
            <p>In short, <strong>complete separation is not an attack on religion</strong>; it is a protection of both religion and democracy from being misused against each other.</p>

            <h2>6. From Europe To The Middle East: Why This Matters For Israel–Palestine</h2>
            <p>The relevance of this European debate goes beyond EU borders. <strong>The 77‑year‑long conflict between Israel and Palestine</strong> is often framed – both locally and internationally – as a mixture of territory, national identity, and religion.</p>
            <p>In a world where states and political institutions still <strong>privilege certain religions over others</strong>, conflicts like Israel–Palestine are easily turned into civilisational or religious struggles:</p>
            <p>“The West” is sometimes framed as “Christian” or “Judeo‑Christian,” implicitly pitted against predominantly Muslim societies. Political support or condemnation can then appear religiously motivated, even when framed in strategic or humanitarian terms. On the ground, religion, nationalism, and historical trauma are tightly woven together, making compromise emotionally and symbolically harder.</p>
            <p>A <strong>world order built on states that are genuinely secular and truly neutral toward all religions</strong> offers a better foundation for solving such conflicts:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Principled mediation.</strong><br>
            States and institutions that do not identify themselves with any religion are better positioned to mediate conflicts where religion is part of the identity struggle. Their neutrality is more credible.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Universal human rights as a shared standard.</strong><br>
            If political systems are not grounded in religious privilege, they can more consistently apply universal rights: equality before the law, protection from discrimination, the right to security, return, citizenship, and self‑determination.</p>
            <p><strong>3. De‑escalation of identity politics.</strong><br>
            When religion is not fused with state power, religious identity becomes less of a weapon and more of a personal or communal resource. That makes compromise more thinkable, because concessions are no longer framed as betrayals of “God’s side” in a geopolitical struggle.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Intergenerational justice.</strong><br>
            As long as states and political institutions transmit religious and national privileges from one generation to the next, <strong>conflicts are inherited, not solved.</strong> A clear separation helps prevent children from being born into systems that predetermine enemies and allies on religious lines.</p>
            <p>If we want the Israeli–Palestinian conflict not to be passed on yet again to another generation, <strong>the international environment must move away from religiously coded power structures</strong> and toward a genuinely secular and rights‑based order. Reforming Europe’s own incomplete separation between state and church is part of that global shift.</p>

            <h2>7. What Needs To Change In The EU</h2>
            <p>To move from <strong>partial</strong> to <strong>complete</strong> separation between religion and politics in Europe, several steps are crucial:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Honest recognition of Christian privilege.</strong><br>
            Europe must stop pretending that its institutions and party systems are already neutral. Acknowledging the historic and ongoing privileges of Christian churches and Christian‑inspired parties is the first step.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Ending formal religious advantages.</strong><br>
            Where churches enjoy special legal or financial status, or where certain religions are officially recognised and others are not, those frameworks should be re‑examined and reformed on the basis of equality.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Cultural secularisation of institutions.</strong><br>
            Parliaments, courts, and official ceremonies should represent all citizens, not just the religious heritage of the majority. That means rethinking symbols, rituals, and language that implicitly elevate one religion above others.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Reframing party politics.</strong><br>
            Political parties can and will always have value‑based identities, but religious labels and structures that imply special access or moral authority should give way to <strong>inclusive, rights‑based programmes</strong> that serve diverse societies.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Strong protection for pluralism in civil society.</strong><br>
            At the same time, religious communities must be free to organise, speak, and advocate in civil society – on the same terms as any other association – without being turned into arms of the state or scapegoats of it.</p>

            <h2>8. Conclusion: Equal Citizenship In A Plural Europe</h2>
            <p>As long as <strong>Christian parties occupy a normalised, privileged space in the European Parliament while other religious citizens lack comparable representation</strong>, the separation between religion and politics is incomplete. That incompleteness is not neutral. It produces <strong>subtle but real exclusion</strong>, sending the message that some identities are born to rule and others are merely guests.</p>
            <p>Working toward a <strong>complete separation between state and church and between religion and politics</strong> is not an abstract philosophical project. It is a practical reform agenda for making all EU citizens – Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, non‑religious, or otherwise – genuinely equal before the law and in political life, reducing identity‑based tensions inside Europe and beyond, and creating a more consistent, credible foundation for engaging with and helping resolve conflicts like that between Israel and Palestine, instead of reinforcing them through religiously coded power structures.</p>
            <p>Only when no religion is privileged through the machinery of the state and its party systems can we seriously hope to build political orders – in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere – that are <strong>just enough and neutral enough</strong> to avoid passing today’s conflicts on to tomorrow’s children.</p>
