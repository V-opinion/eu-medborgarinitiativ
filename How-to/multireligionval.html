            <h1>Kyrkovalsreform , valet mellan kyrkovalet, Kaplan-systemet och Multireligionvalsystemet</h1>
        </header>

             <article>
                <h2>Mitt riksdagsparti med studentförbund, ungdomsförbund och kvinnoförbund deltar i kyrkovalet men inte jag  , varför ? </h2>
                <p>


Så motiverar förmodligen många  riksdagsledamöter  som tillhör riksdagspartierna, deras respektive ungdomsförbund m fl som inte deltar i kyrkovalet samtidigt som de inte undrar över med vilka pengar riksdagspartierna finansierar kyrkovalets valrörelse..

Socialdemokraterna , Moderaterna, Kristdemokraterna ,Sverigedemokraterna ,Liberalerna,
 Centerpartiet , Vänsterpartiet  och  Miljöpartiet


Varför håller riksdagsparterna fast vid den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik genom b l a kyrkovalet ?
De  349  riksdagsledamöterna  är indelade i ytterligare tre grupperingar
1) De som deltar ,  röstar i kyrkovalet  som får följa partilinjen
2) De som har lämnat svenska kyrkan och inte får rösta dvs inte får följa parti linjen .
3) De som har två valmöjligheter ,protestantiska riksdagsledamöter som deltar i kyrkovalet och har rösträtt som de kan avstå från, rösta eller avstå , följa eller inte följa partilinjren

Medan de  ledamöter i riksdagspartierna som tillhör ett annat trossamfund än protestantiska dvs buddist, hindu, jude , katolik eller muslim inte har samma rätt att följa sitt parti i kyrkovalets valrörelse, med bara en valmöjlighet d v s de får  inte delta.
De får heller inte veta varför deras parti deltar i ett religiöst kristet val  när kyrka och stat är separerade så även mellan religion och politik  .

Detta stora problem  uttnyttjas av två riksdaspartier SD och KD som  genom kyrkovalet och kyrkomötet bedriver en  häxjakt mot en av de största religionerna.

Problemet är varken RF , kontrollmakten KU , talmannen eller riksdagen  dessa 349 mandat som är delad i två klyftor , de ledamöter som har rösträtt i kyrkovalet, och de  ledamöter som tillhör ett annat trossamfund än protestantism och som inte har samma rätt. Inte ens vaför bara protestantiska trossamfund har gjort det möjligt att välja en  kvinnlig ärkebiskop men inte de andra
 vilket är ett. stort demokrati och jämställdhetsproblem.

Diskriminering från svenska kyrkan, riksdagspartierna eller talmannen som öppnar två parallella parlament , riksdagen och kyrkomötet som andra politiker tillhörande andra trossamfund inte får delta i.

Eller att dessa politiker förmodligen  inte har reflekterat  över att detta altenativ omedvetet har exkluderat dem själva och andra ungdomar från den rättigheten och därför saknar de denna rösträtt som gör att  riksdagen inte är  jämställd som folkets företrädare ur den synvinkel de har som saknar rösträtt.
Är inte medvetna om att den protestantiska kyrkan därför har infört demokrati i form av kyrkoval men inte andra trossamfund vars medlemmar har flytt från diktaturer och krig  .
Detta kan också bero på att de inte lyckats övertala sina religiösa ledare att det är demokratin som har givit de religionsfrihet och därför borde de arbeta för kyrkovalsreformen.
Alternativet är att de  är nöjda med att få vara lediga från riksdagen under
kyrkovalsrörelsen medan de andra ledamöterna som har rösträtt som har engagerat sig i något annat än vad det svenska folket egentligen har givit dem uppdrag för..

Och att trossamfund som är icke protestantiska är nöjda med statsbidrag som de får utan krav och att riksdagsledamöterna som  får röster från dessa trossamfund också är nöjda med att få statsbidrag.
Att samtliga trossamfund vill ha kvar den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik
Frågan  är om riksdagspartierna är eniga om
Att kyrkan och staten gick skilda vägar för 25 år sedan ,
Att religionen  inte skall blanda sig i politiken ,
Att politikerna endast skall ägna sig åt sitt uppdrag som de fick av svenska folket,
Att partistödet ges för att främja demokratin och det skall inte vara beroende av anonyma källor som påverkar deras politik och  att partistödet inte skall finansiera kyrkovalrörelsen
Att religionsfriheten är en grundbult i vår demokrati. Det innebär att demokratin har givit oss religionsfrihet .

Kyrkovalsreformen innebär att en övergång från kyrkoval till ett Multireligionvalsystem.
I de nordiska länderna som redan har kyrkoval och införande av Multireligionvalsystem inom EU och så småningom i övriga länder .

Genom detta uppfyller vi flera syfte b l a
En konfliktlhanteringsmodell gällande den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina.
Att fullborda separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik

Det som underlättar denna övergång är att de flesta nordiska länder redan har kyrkoval och att även de som fyllt 16 år har rösträtt och får praktisera demokrati två år innan riksdagsvalet .

                <h2>Bakgrund och analys</h2>
                <p>
                  <span style="color: #CC402B"></span> <br> Hur kommer det sig att politiker med invandrarbakgrund är dåliga på att hävda sina egna och andras grundläggande rättigheter  ?<br>

Att göra det möjligt för en politiker med invandrarbakgrund  att väljas till
statsministerposten  .<br> Den posten förblir bokad för en svensk protestantisk politiker som har rösträtt och deltar eller följer partilinjen i kyrkovalet.

<br>Att  t ex konvertera V:s partiledare eller L-ledaren Mohamsson till  kristendom, protestantism,kan inte vara den enda vägen till att en politiker med invandrarbakgrund skall  få rätt att kunna bli vald till svensk statsminister .

<br>Eller skall det ta lika lång tid som när de svenska kvinnorna som fick rösträtt 1921 och att det sedan dröjde över hundra år innan den första kvinnan  lyckades bli vald till statsminister  , hon heter Magdalena Andersson (S)  . Trots detta schabblade hon bort makten till SD efter ett kortvarigt mandat, cirka 7 månader. Ett stort bakslag  för svenska kvinnors kamp för jämställdhet särskilt vad gäller  kvinnor med invandrarbakgrund.
Varken manliga eller kvinnliga politiker med invandrarbakgrund  har lyckats med att åstadkomma en förändring . Detta kan bero på okunskap, detta  även när det gäller kyrkovalet.

<br>Efter Branting tvingades S att dela på makten inom partiet, mellan Per Albin Hansson som fick statsministerposten och Richard Sandler som fick rollen som partiledare.
Jämställdhetsminister som motarbetar jämställdhet och  en demokratiminister som icke är  demokratisk.

<br>1) Separera statsministerposten från rollen som partiledare.
<br>2) Kyrkovalsreform
<br>Den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik

<br>Om de  gamla partierna som  MP , V och C får chansen att bilda en samlingsregering enligt principen att i kris bildas samlingsregering och i det här fallet  skall V, vars partiledare har invandrarbakgrund, erhålla statsministerposten.
<br>Motiveringen är att S och Tidöpartiernas politik varit behäftad med många skandaler vid sidan av NATO krisen , anslutning utan föregående folkomröstning m m vilket har gjort Sverige svagt och impopulärt, även utomlands, samt en  sämre  tilltro till  Nobels priser då  två NATO- länder delar ut Nobelpriserna.
<br>Denna handlingskraftiga samlingsregering skall också  vidta åtgärder mot den bristfälliga demokrati som tillämpas i de länder som påstår sig ha en fungerande demokrati, USA, EU , Israel      m fl   och som kan göra att  den 77 år långa konfliketn mellan Israel och Palestina  blir möjlig att lösa.

<br>Låt inte Mos 12:1:  utnyttjas av kristna ytterhögerpartier och sionister  inom EU , Israel och USA  för att legitimera ockupation, bosättningar, pågående folkmord , mord på hittills
70 000 palestinier m.m , och kyrkovalet som utnyttjas av högerextremister för att kränka en av de största religionerna och som i sin tur utnyttjas för en ofullbordad separation mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik , där en f d statsminister tillika partiledare som uteslutit all politisk kunskap och  sin ideologi och i stället vänt sig till kyrkan där han  nominerades i kyrkovalet  sep 2025  .
Vapenindustrin (försvarsindustrin Elbit Systems Sweden - ett dotterbolag till det israeliska Elbit Systems  .Elbit Systems producerar drönare som används av IDF i Gaza  ) samt oljeindustrin som också är en ohållbar och miljöförstörande industri och därför måste den avvecklas på samma sätt som tobaksindustrin !

                <h2>Varför politiker och fredspristagare undviker att återuppliva Osloavtalen</h2>
                <p>
                    Varför politiker och fredspristagare undviker att återuppliva Osloavtalen – och varför det är vår uppgift att förhindra att Israel-Palestina-konflikten går vidare till en annan generation
<br>I över sjuttiosju år har Israel-Palestina-konflikten format två folks öden, dragit linjer av splittring och hjärtesorg över generationer. Osloavtalen, som förhandlades fram på 1990-talet, väckte en gång globalt hopp – de markerade de första direkta avtalen, ömsesidigt erkännande och en färdplan mot fred. Ändå verkar politiker och till och med Nobelpristagare i fred idag ovilliga att nämna, än mindre återuppliva, Osloprocessen. Varför?
<br>Politiker föredrar att uppvakta nya, mindre kontroversiella ramverk, snarare än att återuppta ett avtal som många ser som "dött" eller en symbol för förlorat hopp.
<br>-Mordet på Nobels freds pristagare som deltog i Oslo-avtalet utfördes av egna judiska terrorister som satte stopp för freden i Mellanöstern
Varför mördades  Nobels fredspristagare Yitzhak Rabin , en jude, premiärminister och fredspristagare av egna  judiska terrorister ?
<br>Det mordet genomfördes av religiösa judiska terrorister och därför  skiljer sig det från mordet på icke-fredspristagare, som mordet på Kennedy och Palme som var politiska.
<br>Den 30-åriga religiösa konflikten mellan protestanter och katoliker , 30-åriga kriget kunde man lösa , även den religösa konflikten mellan katoliker och protestanter i Nordirand kunde man lösa men inte den 77- åriga konflikten som berör två helt olika religioner , judar och muslimer.
Ockupation och bosättningar har lett till folkmord i Gaza vilket i sin tur har lett till att FN:s brottmålsdomstol beslutade att arrestera den judiska statens regeringschef, Natnyaho tillsammans med andra som styr den judiska staten.
<br>Det handlar inte om vilket mord som helst utan det handlar om att hela världen engagerar sig för att lyckas med att genomföra Oslo-avtalet. Därför skall man gå till botten med att granska varför ingen politiker vill ta upp och återuppliva detta..

                <h2>Kyrkovalet , Kaplansystemet eller Multireligionvalsystem</h2>
                <p>
                    Vilket system är ett konflikthanteringssystem vad gäller  bl a den mest komplicerade, Israel-Palestina-konflikten? Är det  Kyrkovalsystemet , Kaplansystemet eller Multireligionvalsystemet ?
<br>Eftersom vare sig Kyrkovalet eller  Kaplansystemet har lyckats med att lösa den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina och inte ens genom någon politisk ideologi, såsom Socialism, Konservatism, Liberalism eller Ecologism medan ett Multireligionvalsystem  klarar av att hantera en sådan komplex och svårlöst konflikt som Israel-Palestina konflikten.  .
Vad är en Kaplan ?
<br>Kaplan är en präst med särskilt ansvar tex särskilt ansvar i USA:s kongress , i de nordiska länderna kan det vara en kyrkopolitiker som håller begravningstal .
 kaplan i den amerikanska kongressen har historiskt sett alltid varit kristen (mestadels protestanter eller katoliker).
<br>Valet av en kaplan beslutas av ledamöterna i varje kammare (representanthuset eller senaten).
<br>Det faktum att alla heltidsanställda kongresspräster i USA har varit kristna är ett exempel på hur separationen mellan kyrka och stat – och mellan religion och politik – inte är fullt ut förverkligad i praktiken.
Den ofullbordade separationen  mellan stat och kyrka samt  mellan religion och politik
Själva kaplansämbetet är ett religiöst ämbete inom en sekulär regeringsstruktur. Även om det är avsett som ceremoniellt eller stödjande, är det ett synligt tecken på religion i politiken och den offentliga sfären.

<br>Kaplan : Lobbyverksamhet och opinionsbildning:
Liksom andra intressegrupper kan religiösa organisationer lobba kongressledamöter, lämna in vittnesmål, förespråka för eller emot lagstiftning och delta i policydiskussioner. Detta görs externt, genom samma kanaler som fackföreningar, näringslivsgrupper eller ideella organisationer. De försöker övertyga lagstiftare, men de är inte en del av den lagstiftande makten.
I den 119:e kongressen i USA (2025–2027) finns representation den överväldigande majoriteten är kristna.Kristna grupper: Protestantiska (metodister, baptister, presbyterianska, lutherska, episkopaliska, icke-konfessionella evangeliska m f l)
Den fortsatta traditionen med enbart kristna kaplaner återspeglar en historisk kristen dominans i amerikansk regering och kultur. Den visar hur vissa religiösa symboler och sedvänjor fortfarande är sammanflätade med statliga institutioner, även i ett land som lagligen upprätthåller strikt separation mellan kyrka och stat.
Även om lagen tillåter att vilken trosriktning som helst representeras i kaplanskapet, har kristna kaplaner i praktiken alltid haft den permanenta posten. Icke-kristna kaplaner har endast deltagit som gäster – vilket tyder på kvarstående sociala och institutionella preferenser.
En Kaplan får inte vara en buddist, muslim eller hindu utan skall vara kristen.
 En Kaplan får inte vara en kvinna .
Fullständig separation är därför svår att genomföra på grund av djupa historiska rötter, kulturella preferenser, majoritetens religiösa identitet och den symboliska betydelse som vissa traditioner har. Det skulle kräva både juridiska reformer och en förändring av offentliga värderingar.

Denna ”ofullständiga separation” finns även i andra länder (som Sverige), där gamla band kvarstår trots reformer som syftar till att etablera neutralitet och jämlikhet mellan religioner.
Fullständig separation innebär en regering som är neutral, sekulär och lika öppen för alla individer – oavsett religiös övertygelse – där religionen är helt privat och exkluderad från officiella statliga funktioner. Detta är en pågående process, inte bara en uppsättning policyer, och kräver både institutionell och kulturell omvandling.
Om religiösa organisationer skulle få ett eget valsystem och ett eget parlament genom ett valsystem med flera religioner, Multireligionvalsystem, skulle det faktiskt skapa större sammanflätning mellan religion och politik, inte mer separation. Här är anledningen:
Politisk makt för religioner:
Att ge religiösa grupper befogenhet att välja representanter till ett separat religiöst parlament skulle formalisera religionens roll som politisk aktör och potentiellt ge den inflytande inom lagstiftande, politiska eller statliga frågor.
 Ett sådant separat religiöst parlament är The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System
Institutionalisering av religiös representation:
Detta skulle skapa parallella strukturer – en sekulär (nationella/delstatliga regeringar) och en religiös (parlamentet med flera religioner) – FRC vilket skulle leda till ett system där regeringsbeslut skulle kunna påverkas, granskas eller till och med läggas in veto mot av religiösa myndigheter
Människor utan religion  får kandidera sig på samma sätt som de som tillhör ett trossamfund.
Verklig separation löser  svårtlösta konflikter som exempelvis Israel-Palestina konflikten.:
Målet med separationen mellan kyrka och stat och religion och politik är att regeringen ska behandla alla trosuppfattningar lika, utan institutionaliserad religiös auktoritet eller representation. Religion förblir en privat eller samhällsmässig angelägenhet, inte en politisk eller lagstiftande angelägenhet som de religiösa partierna i EU-parlamentet.

Slutsats:
Ett parlament eller valsystem med flera religioner -The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC)  en verklig separation som  innebär att religionen inte har någon institutionell roll i politiska strukturer – representation bör ske genom geografi, medborgarskap eller individuella rättigheter, inte religion..

                                <p>

We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception. A transition from church elections to a multi-religion election system in those countries that already have church elections, In other countries (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel…..) that do not have similar elections, a multi-religion electoral system is introduced. !
<br>The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod.

                    This article questions why politicians with immigrant backgrounds in Sweden rarely defend their own and others&apos; fundamental rights, and why access to the office of prime minister seems tied to Protestant affiliation and participation in church elections. It argues for a clearer separation between state and church, reforms of the church elections, and a possible government of national unity led by a prime minister with an immigrant background, while also criticising global democratic deficits and the role of the arms and oil industries.

                <h2>Politicians with immigrant backgrounds and fundamental rights</h2>

                <p>
                    Why is it that politicians with immigrant backgrounds are so poor at defending their own and others’ fundamental rights?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making it possible for a politician with an immigrant background to be elected to the office of prime minister is crucial. Today, that office in practice remains reserved for a Swedish Protestant politician who has voting rights in the Church of Sweden and who participates in, or follows the party line in, church elections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To, for example, convert the party leader of the Left Party or the Liberal Party leader Mohamsson to Christianity and then to Protestantism cannot be the only path for a politician with an immigrant background to gain the right to be elected as Sweden’s prime minister.

                    Or is it supposed to take just as long as it did for Swedish women, who gained the right to vote in 1921, and then had to wait more than one hundred years before the first woman succeeded in being elected prime minister? Her name is Magdalena Andersson (S). Despite this historic step, she fumbled power to the Sweden Democrats after a short mandate period of about seven months. This was a major setback for Swedish women’s struggle for equality, especially for women with immigrant backgrounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Neither male nor female politicians with immigrant backgrounds have succeeded in bringing about change. This may be due to a lack of knowledge, including about the church elections.
                </p>

                <h2>Historical background within the Social Democratic Party</h2>

                <p>
                    After Branting, the Social Democratic Party (S) was forced to share power within the party, between Per Albin Hansson, who received the office of prime minister, and Richard Sandler, who became party leader. We see a pattern of an equality minister who works against equality and a minister for democracy who is not democratic.
                </p>

                <h2>Proposed reforms of democracy and power structures</h2>

                <h3>1) Separate the office of prime minister from the role of party leader</h3>

                <p>
                    1) Separate the office of prime minister from the role of party leader.
                </p>

                <h3>2) Church election reform and a completed separation of state and church</h3>

                <p>
                    2) Church election reform – to complete the unfinished separation between state and church, and between religion and politics.
                </p>

                <h2>A government of national unity with a prime minister of immigrant background</h2>

                <p>
                    If the old parties such as the Green Party (MP), the Left Party (V) and the Centre Party (C) were given the opportunity to form a government of national unity, according to the principle that in times of crisis a unity government is formed, then in this case the Left Party, whose party leader has an immigrant background, should be given the office of prime minister.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The motivation is that the policies of the Social Democrats (S) and the Tidö parties have been marred by numerous scandals, alongside the NATO crisis – accession without a prior referendum, among other things – which has weakened Sweden and made the country unpopular abroad. It has also undermined confidence in the Nobel Prizes, as two NATO countries now award Nobel Prizes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Such a decisive unity government should also take measures against the deficient democracy practiced in countries that claim to have a functioning democracy – the USA, the EU, Israel and others – and thereby help make it possible to resolve the 77‑year‑old conflict between Israel and Palestine.
                </p>

                <h2>Biblical interpretation, church elections and misuse of power</h2>

                <p>
                    Let us not allow Deuteronomy 12:1 to be exploited by Christian far‑right parties and Zionists within the EU, Israel and the USA to legitimise occupation, settlements, ongoing mass killings and the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as well as other abuses. Nor should church elections be misused by right‑wing extremists to attack one of the world’s major religions, and thereby perpetuate an incomplete separation between state and church and between religion and politics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this context we also see a former prime minister and party leader who has set aside political knowledge and ideology and instead turned to the church, where he has been nominated in the church election in September 2025.
                </p>

                <h2>The arms industry, the oil industry and the environment</h2>

                <p>
                    The arms industry (the defence company Elbit Systems Sweden – a subsidiary of the Israeli company Elbit Systems, which produces drones used by the IDF in Gaza) and the oil industry are both unsustainable and environmentally destructive industries. They must therefore be phased out in the same way as the tobacco industry.
                </p>
