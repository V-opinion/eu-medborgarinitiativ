        What Is a Multi-Religion Election System?
      </h1>

      <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        A multi-religion election system is a democratic model that gives
        different religious communities a formal role in political decision‑making.
        Instead of treating religion only as a private matter, it recognizes that
        faith can strongly influence how people vote, and it builds this reality
        into the design of elections and representation.
      </p>

      <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        In a multi-religion election system, each recognized religious community
        can have a structured way to participate – for example through separate
        electoral rolls, reserved seats, or shared decision‑making rules. At the
        same time, the system must protect equal rights for every individual,
        including those who do not belong to any religion.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin:24px 0 12px 0; color:#ffffff;">
        Why connect religion and democracy?
      </h2>

      <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
        In many countries, conflicts about religion and politics are not solved
        by ignoring religion. They are made worse. A multi‑religion election
        system tries to reduce conflict by giving each community a clear,
        transparent role inside a democratic framework, instead of letting power
        struggles happen in the shadows.
