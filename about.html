      De Nya Svenskarna is a Sweden-based, globally oriented initiative that connects religion,
      democracy and peacebuilding in a new way. Starting from the Nordic experience of democratic
      church elections, we develop and promote the Multi-Religious Election System as a concrete
      conflict-resolution model. Our work shows how democratic elections inside churches and other
      faith communities can strengthen youth participation, gender equality, and accountability, and
      how these internal reforms can support international law, human rights and long-term peace in
      conflict-affected regions.

      We work at the intersection of policy influence, public awareness, and education for refugees
      and faith communities. From Sweden and the EU, we reach refugees, churches and policymakers
      online with educational materials, briefs and seminar concepts that explain how church
      elections and religious democracy can help separate religion from state power while making
      religious leadership more representative and peace-oriented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where many interfaith and refugee organizations focus on dialogue or humanitarian support,
      De Nya Svenskarna adds a unique focus on democratic governance inside religious communities
      themselves, offering a clear, transferable reform model that can be adapted from the Nordic
      context to multi-religious societies worldwide.
