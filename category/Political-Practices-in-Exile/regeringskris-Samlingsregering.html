   <h3>FDU föreslår tre lösningar på regeringskrisen</h3>
   <div class="entrybody"><div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;FDU föreslår tre 
lösningar på regeringskrisen: Extraval ,Samlingsregering utan SD, L och
 Kd eller så kan S ensamt fortsätta som en minoritetsregering såsom <strong>Ola Ullstens</strong> minioritetsregering 1978–1979.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;I sina memoarer <em>Så blev det</em> skrev <strong>Ola Ullsten följande:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Hur man bär sig åt för att bilda en regering när man har knappt 10 procent av rösterna.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fälldins regering från 1976 sprack på 
grund av kärnkraften och förhandlingarna bakom kulisserna ledde fram 
till bildandet av fp-regeringen 1978</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;Ullstens regering bestod endast av 19 folkpartistiska statsråd b.la med <span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birgit_Friggebo" rel="nofollow"><strong>Birgit Friggebo</strong></a></span></span></span> som bostadsminister och <span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertil_Hansson" rel="nofollow"><strong>Bertil Hansson</strong></a></span></span></span><strong> som </strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_kyrkominister" rel="nofollow"><strong>kyrkominister </strong></a></span></span></span><strong>och </strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix" rel="nofollow"><strong>Hans Blix</strong></a></span></span></span><strong> som </strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_utrikesminister" rel="nofollow"><strong>Utrikes-</strong></a></span></span></span><strong> och </strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_bist%C3%A5ndsminister" rel="nofollow"><strong>biståndsminister</strong></a></span></span></span><strong>
 . I det här fallet visste Ullsten att inget av de övriga partierna 
skulle ha för avsikt att fälla hans regering innan nästa val.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">När det förekommer tvångsvärvning av LO 
till socialdemokratiska partiet om man inte reserverar sig, uppstår det 
en klumpröstning och det förekommer även dold anslutning till svenska 
kyrkan av muslimer alltså en konvertering till kristendom i smyg. Detta 
kan endast upptäckas på deklarationsblanketten då de får betala skatt 
till svenska kyrkan, alltså inte endast den begravningsavgift som alla 
får betala, utan de har ovetandes blivit påtvingade ett medlemskap I den
 svenska kyrkan vilket verkar helt rättsvidrigt.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">För det tredje, invandrarnas riksförbunds
 roll I demokratin och den roll som de eventuellt spelat när det gäller 
det kaos som nu uppstått I regeringen. Demokratin och religionsfriheten 
måste hela tiden diskuteras.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Uteslutning I regeringssamarbete av SD bl
 a pga sin historiska bakgrund, rasism och främlingsfientlighet, vilket 
de inte tagit avstånd ifrån. Likaså om L och KD inte avstår från att 
försvara Israels politik men däremot är det självklart att de ska 
försvara det judiska folket på samma sätt som det palestinska folket.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Trots detta betraktas den nuvarande 
regeringen, S och MP, som den mest jämställda regeringen då den består 
av hälften kvinnor och flera med olika invandrarbakgrunder som statsråd.
 En regering med sådan mångfald ska uppmuntras även i fortsättningen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;<strong>Krigen utgör ett hot mot miljön &amp; mänskligheten</strong></p>
