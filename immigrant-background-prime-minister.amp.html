                    This article questions why politicians with immigrant backgrounds in Sweden rarely defend their own and others&apos; fundamental rights, and why access to the office of prime minister seems tied to Protestant affiliation and participation in church elections. It argues for a clearer separation between state and church, reforms of the church elections, and a possible government of national unity led by a prime minister with an immigrant background, while also criticising global democratic deficits and the role of the arms and oil industries.

                <h2>Politicians with immigrant backgrounds and fundamental rights</h2>

                <p>
                    Why is it that politicians with immigrant backgrounds are so poor at defending their own and others’ fundamental rights?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making it possible for a politician with an immigrant background to be elected to the office of prime minister is crucial. Today, that office in practice remains reserved for a Swedish Protestant politician who has voting rights in the Church of Sweden and who participates in, or follows the party line in, church elections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To, for example, convert the party leader of the Left Party or the Liberal Party leader Mohamsson to Christianity and then to Protestantism cannot be the only path for a politician with an immigrant background to gain the right to be elected as Sweden’s prime minister.
                </p>

                <h2>A comparison with women’s struggle for suffrage and the prime minister’s office</h2>

                <p>
                    Or is it supposed to take just as long as it did for Swedish women, who gained the right to vote in 1921, and then had to wait more than one hundred years before the first woman succeeded in being elected prime minister? Her name is Magdalena Andersson (S). Despite this historic step, she fumbled power to the Sweden Democrats after a short mandate period of about seven months. This was a major setback for Swedish women’s struggle for equality, especially for women with immigrant backgrounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Neither male nor female politicians with immigrant backgrounds have succeeded in bringing about change. This may be due to a lack of knowledge, including about the church elections.
                </p>

                <h2>Historical background within the Social Democratic Party</h2>

                <p>
                    After Branting, the Social Democratic Party (S) was forced to share power within the party, between Per Albin Hansson, who received the office of prime minister, and Richard Sandler, who became party leader. We see a pattern of an equality minister who works against equality and a minister for democracy who is not democratic.
                </p>

                <h2>Proposed reforms of democracy and power structures</h2>

                <h3>1) Separate the office of prime minister from the role of party leader</h3>

                <p>
                    1) Separate the office of prime minister from the role of party leader.
                </p>

                <h3>2) Church election reform and a completed separation of state and church</h3>

                <p>
                    2) Church election reform – to complete the unfinished separation between state and church, and between religion and politics.
                </p>

                <h2>A government of national unity with a prime minister of immigrant background</h2>

                <p>
                    If the old parties such as the Green Party (MP), the Left Party (V) and the Centre Party (C) were given the opportunity to form a government of national unity, according to the principle that in times of crisis a unity government is formed, then in this case the Left Party, whose party leader has an immigrant background, should be given the office of prime minister.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The motivation is that the policies of the Social Democrats (S) and the Tidö parties have been marred by numerous scandals, alongside the NATO crisis – accession without a prior referendum, among other things – which has weakened Sweden and made the country unpopular abroad. It has also undermined confidence in the Nobel Prizes, as two NATO countries now award Nobel Prizes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Such a decisive unity government should also take measures against the deficient democracy practiced in countries that claim to have a functioning democracy – the USA, the EU, Israel and others – and thereby help make it possible to resolve the 77‑year‑old conflict between Israel and Palestine.
                </p>

                <h2>Biblical interpretation, church elections and misuse of power</h2>

                <p>
                    Let us not allow Deuteronomy 12:1 to be exploited by Christian far‑right parties and Zionists within the EU, Israel and the USA to legitimise occupation, settlements, ongoing mass killings and the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, as well as other abuses. Nor should church elections be misused by right‑wing extremists to attack one of the world’s major religions, and thereby perpetuate an incomplete separation between state and church and between religion and politics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this context we also see a former prime minister and party leader who has set aside political knowledge and ideology and instead turned to the church, where he has been nominated in the church election in September 2025.
                </p>

                <h2>The arms industry, the oil industry and the environment</h2>

                <p>
                    The arms industry (the defence company Elbit Systems Sweden – a subsidiary of the Israeli company Elbit Systems, which produces drones used by the IDF in Gaza) and the oil industry are both unsustainable and environmentally destructive industries. They must therefore be phased out in the same way as the tobacco industry.
