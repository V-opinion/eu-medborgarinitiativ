            <h2>What is meant by separation of church and state and between religion and politics?</h2>
            <p>   Why Politicians and Peace Laureates Avoid Reviving the Oslo Accords—and Why It’s Our Task to Prevent the Israel-Palestine Conflict Passing to Another Generation
For over seventy-seven years, the Israel-Palestine conflict has shaped the fate of two peoples, drawing lines of division and heartbreak across generations. The Oslo Accords, negotiated in the 1990s, once kindled global hope—marking the first direct agreements, mutual recognition, and a roadmap to peace. Yet today, politicians and even Nobel Peace laureates seem reluctant to mention, let alone revive, the Oslo process. Why?

<br>1. Political Risks and Polarization
The Oslo Accords are deeply controversial. Leaders who champion them face fierce resistance, not only from hardline opponents on both sides, but also from their own coalitions and voters. <br>In Israel, any move toward territorial compromise or a Palestinian state can cost politicians their careers, inspire public protest, or—in tragic extremity—endanger their lives (as with Rabin’s assassination). Palestinian leaders risk being branded traitors or collaborators. <br>For global statesmen, supporting Oslo can mean alienating powerful lobbies and interests at home and abroad. <br>

<br>2. Erosion of Faith and Trust
After three decades, Oslo is seen by many as a set of broken promises. Its gradualism failed to deliver a final-status agreement, justice for refugees, Jerusalem’s sovereignty, and an end to settlements. When the process stalled and violence flared, public cynicism grew. Politicians prefer to court new, less controversial frameworks, rather than revisit an agreement many see as "dead" or a symbol of lost hope.

<br>3. Change in Global Focus
The world’s attention has turned to other crises: Ukraine, climate, pandemics, rising nationalism. Meanwhile, the complexity and duration of the Israel-Palestine conflict makes it seem “unsolvable” and risks being filed away—tragically—as a “historical stalemate.”

<br>4. Peace Laureates and the Burden of Legacy
Nobel Peace Prize winners, who once put Oslo in the global spotlight, now hesitate to voice unpopular or “failed” solutions. Some are entangled in political realities; others prefer broad appeals for peace rather than detailed proposals. Few wish to risk their legacies by associating with a process that did not achieve its promised result.

<br>Why Reviving Oslo Is Our Task
Passing the conflict to another generation is the failure of both leadership and civil society. It is our responsibility—citizens, activists, scholars, communities—to keep the spirit of Oslo alive, not as a rigid blueprint, but as a symbol of direct dialogue, courage, and pragmatic coexistence.
Reviving Oslo means renewing the commitment to mutual recognition, negotiation, and compromise.
It means rejecting extremism and refusing to be paralyzed by past disappointments.
It requires pressing those in power to act, and providing fresh, grassroots energy to demand peace—not just for ourselves, but for the children of both nations.

Conclusion
Politicians and peace laureates may be silent, but silence is not an option for those who seek justice, stability, and hope. The Oslo Accords were not perfect, but they embodied the possibility that relentless enmity could yield, even briefly, to dialogue. Now, as the seasons advance and generations wait, it is our task to revive that possibility—so that the 77-year-old conflict does not become the inheritance of our children, but instead, the lesson of peace that we leave for them.
                It means government institutions remain neutral toward all religions, with no official religious influence on lawmaking, leadership, or public policy. True separation protects freedom of religion and citizenship equality.

            <h2>Do religious extremism and parties affect peace and politics?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes—extremists oppose compromise, incite conflict, and can derail peace (e.g. Rabin’s assassination). Mainstream religious parties (Christian Democrats, etc.) shape social policy and values in Europe but generally work within democratic frameworks, unlike extremists.

            <h2>Are religious parties present in the EU Parliament and the Swedish Riksdag?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, parties like the European Christian Political Party and Sweden’s Christian Democrats promote religiously-inspired values (family, education, social justice) in political debate and governance.

            <h2>How do religious values influence party platforms in Europe?</h2>

                They shape stances on family, welfare, education, bioethics, and immigration—often emphasizing solidarity, human dignity, and societal responsibilities derived from religious traditions, especially Christian social teaching.

            <h2>Are church elections in the Nordic countries effective conflict resolution models?</h2>
            <p>
                Church elections democratize religious leadership (lay member voting), but face challenges of inclusivity, declining turnout, and blurred church-state boundaries. Reforms toward neutrality and equality are needed for true conflict prevention in diverse societies.

                In the Lutheran churches of Scandinavia (e.g., Sweden), democratic elections made it possible for women to be archbishops. This is not possible in Catholic or Orthodox churches, which restrict leadership to men by doctrine.
