    <h1>A Multi-Religion Election System – For Researchers</h1>
    <p>
      This site presents a multi-religion election system as a research framework
      on religion, democracy, electoral system design and conflict resolution in
      multireligious societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A multi-religion election system is a conflict-resolution model for
      multireligious societies, connecting religion, democracy, peacebuilding and
      sustainable development. It is relevant for researchers, policymakers,
      religious communities and international organisations.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section id="research-overview">
    <h2>What Is a Multi-Religion Election System?</h2>
    <h2>Why Is a Multi-Religion Election System Needed?</h2>
    <h2>FDU – for Peace, Democracy and Sustainable Development</h2>

    <p>
      A multi-religion election system is a normative and
      institutionally-oriented model designed for religiously diverse societies
      where the separation between state and religion remains incomplete. It
      asks how electoral systems and representative institutions can be
      structured to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mitigate religiously framed political conflicts</li>
      <li>Protect minority communities and non-believers</li>
      <li>Prevent structural domination by any single religious tradition</li>
      <li>Strengthen democratic legitimacy and trust in public institutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The model is intended as a flexible framework, not a single fixed
      blueprint. It can therefore be adapted to different constitutional,
      historical and cultural contexts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="theoretical-foundations">
    <h2>Theoretical Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      A multi-religion election system engages with several established
      research traditions, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consociationalism and power-sharing</strong> in deeply divided
        societies
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electoral system design</strong> (proportional representation,
        mixed systems, reserved seats and quotas)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Religion and politics</strong>, including state–religion
        relations and models of secularism
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conflict resolution and peacebuilding</strong> in
        ethnoreligiously diverse contexts
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Human rights and constitutional law</strong>, especially freedom
        of religion and non-discrimination
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The aim is to integrate insights from these fields into a coherent
      framework that can guide both empirical analysis and institutional
      innovation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="research-questions">
    <h2>Core Research Questions</h2>
    <p>
      A multi-religion election system raises a number of questions that may
      be of interest to scholars in political science, law, religious studies
      and peace research, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Under what conditions do existing electoral systems intensify or
        moderate religious cleavages?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can representation mechanisms acknowledge religious identities
        without entrenching permanent sectarian divisions?
      </li>
      <li>
        What forms of power-sharing or guaranteed representation are compatible
        with liberal-democratic principles and individual rights?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do different models of state–religion relations affect the design
        and functioning of electoral institutions?
      </li>
      <li>
        In what ways can electoral engineering contribute to long-term
        peacebuilding and sustainable development in multireligious societies?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="methodology">
    <h2>Methodological Approaches</h2>
    <p>
      Research on a multi-religion election system can make use of a variety
      of methodological approaches, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparative case studies</strong> of states with strong
        religion–politics linkages
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Normative and conceptual analysis</strong> of legitimacy,
        equality and religious freedom
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Constitutional and legal analysis</strong> of electoral laws and
        state–religion arrangements
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scenario-building and institutional design</strong> (e.g.,
        simulation of alternative electoral rules)
      </li>

      A multi-religion election system – a research framework on religion,
      democracy and conflict resolution in multireligious societies. In my work, I explore <a href=" https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/researchers.html">
a multi-religion election system</a> as a conflict-resolution model in multireligious societies.How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world, The Israel-Palestine conflict by transition from the church election to a multi-religion  election system ?
<br>We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception. A transition from church elections to a multi-religion election system in those countries that already have church elections, In other countries (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel…..) that do not have similar elections, a multi-religion electoral system is introduced. !
<br>The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System
<br>– Multi-Religion Support – The financial model that replaces the SST Foundation and the corresponding party support, but regardless of tax revenue.
    <br></p>  Vad är Multireligionvalsystem<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är en reaktion på den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt religion och politik. En konfliklösningsmodell framför allt siktar på den komplicerade och svårlösta 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina.
En reaktion på varför ingen av FN:s generalsekreterare, påvar, amerikanska presidenter, kungar , politiker , medlare eller Nobels fredspris har lyckats med att lösa den så att den inte överlämnas från den ena generationen till den andra.

<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är en teoretisk modell  som beskriver bakgrund och en analys av  den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt religion och politik och som hindar  att konflikten  mellan Israel och Palestina blir löst .
<br>Här är några typiska fall från krig i gamla tider  och moderna tider..
Mordet på en  f d premiärminister, jude och  Nobels fredspristagare som deltog i Oslo-avtalet, ett mord som utfördes av religiösa judiska extremister , det var ett religiöst motiv som avskräcker även de som arbetar för fred .
Konflikten på Nordirland mellan katoliker och protestanter var också en religiös konflikt men den kunde man lösa efter 30 års av krig.
30-åriga kriget mellan Sverige som protestantiskt och Tykland som katolskt och även den religiösa konflikten lyckades man lösa efter 30 år av krig.

<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är en reaktion på  att demokratin har tillämpats bristfälligt i alla länder även de som kallas för demokratiska länder.den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt religion och politik.

<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är också en reaktion på varför de nordiska länderna har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund, protestantiska, genom kyrkoval medan andra länder motsätter sig detta.

<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är en reaktion på varför bara tre länder inom EU , Sverige , Danmark och Finland har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund d v s de har kyrkoval medan de övriga av EU:s medlemstater inte har gjort det.

<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är en reaktion på varför protestantiska ungdomar som fyllt 16 år får praktisera demokrati två år innan det allmänna valet medan andra ungdomar tillhörande något annat trossamfund även kristna katoliker,och ortodoxa samt judar, muslimer, buddister och hinduer inte får göra det.

<br>Multireligionvalsystemet är en reaktion på varför påveposten alltid tillfaller en man och att det bara är män som får välja påve. I motsats till kyrkovalet som möjliggör att en kvinna kan bli ärkebiskop.
<br>Frågan är om en kvinna får vara kaplan, präst, i den amerikanska kongressen och om amerikanerna kommer att införa demokrati i sina trossamfund.
