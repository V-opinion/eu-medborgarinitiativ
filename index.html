      <h2>Democracy and Religious Freedom</h2>
      <p>Democracy has historically spearheaded the expansion of <strong><a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/comparison/kyrkovalet-vs-Multireligionvalet.html" title="kyrkovalet vs Multireligionval">religious freedom</a></strong>, enabling diverse faith groups to practice openly and equally. Across nations, democratic ideals have been central to ensuring that no religious community is excluded from public life and governance.</p>

      <h2>Why Transition <a href="https://blog.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/topics/category/det-svenska-hemliga-valet/" title="det svenska hemliga valet">from Church Elections to Multi-Religion election Systems</a>?</h2>
      <p>In countries such as Sweden, the Church of Sweden has held democratic church elections since 2000. These elections are open, inclusive, and offer multilingual, postal, and accessible <a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/Nej-till-karnkraft/" title="Folkomröstning ">voting options</a>.</p>
      <p>Globally, most countries do not have similar mechanisms. A <strong><a href="https://a-multi-religion-election-system.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/" title="multireligionvalsystem">multi-religion election system</a></strong> would allow different faith communities to democratically select leadership, ensuring that democracy permeates every religious institution—whether in the USA, UK, China, India, Iran, or Israel.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Multi-Religion Election System?</h2>
      <p>It is an inclusive voting framework where <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/profile/06562567138399317091" title="How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world ?">all recognized religious communities participate in structured</a>, fair elections to choose their representatives or leaders. This could be implemented at local, national, or interfaith levels.</p>
        <br>Varför politiker och fredspristagare undviker att återuppliva Osloavtalen – och varför det är vår uppgift att förhindra att Israel-Palestina-konflikten går vidare till en annan generation Vilket system är ett konflikthanteringssystem vad gäller bl a den mest komplicerade, Israel-Palestina-konflikten? Är det Kyrkovalsystemet , Kaplansystemet eller Multireligionvalsystemet ? Eftersom vare sig Kyrkovalet eller Kaplansystemet har lyckats med att lösa den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina och inte ens genom någon politisk ideologi, såsom Socialism, Konservatism, Liberalism eller Ecologism medan ett Multireligionvalsystem klarar av att hantera en sådan komplex och svårlöst konflikt som Israel-Palestina konflikten. .<br> Vad är en Kaplan ? <br>Kaplan är en präst med särskilt ansvar tex särskilt ansvar i USA:s kongress , i de nordiska länderna kan det vara en kyrkopolitiker som håller begravningstal . En kaplan i den amerikanska kongressen har historiskt sett alltid varit kristen (mestadels protestanter eller katoliker). <br>Valet av en kaplan beslutas av ledamöterna i varje kammare (representanthuset eller senaten). Det faktum att alla heltidsanställda kongresspräster i USA har varit kristna är ett exempel på hur separationen mellan kyrka och stat – och mellan religion och politik – inte är fullt ut förverkligad i praktiken. Den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik Själva kaplansämbetet är ett religiöst ämbete inom en sekulär regeringsstruktur. Även om det är avsett som ceremoniellt eller stödjande, är det ett synligt tecken på religion i politiken och den offentliga sfären. Kaplan : Lobbyverksamhet och opinionsbildning: Liksom andra intressegrupper kan religiösa organisationer lobba kongressledamöter, lämna in vittnesmål, förespråka för eller emot lagstiftning och delta i policydiskussioner. Detta görs externt, genom samma kanaler som fackföreningar, näringslivsgrupper eller ideella organisationer. De försöker övertyga lagstiftare, men de är inte en del av den lagstiftande makten. I den 119:e kongressen i USA (2025–2027) finns representation den överväldigande majoriteten är kristna.Kristna grupper: Protestantiska (metodister, baptister, presbyterianska, lutherska, episkopaliska, icke-konfessionella evangeliska m f l) Den fortsatta traditionen med enbart kristna kaplaner återspeglar en historisk kristen dominans i amerikansk regering och kultur. Den visar hur vissa religiösa symboler och sedvänjor fortfarande är sammanflätade med statliga institutioner, även i ett land som lagligen upprätthåller strikt separation mellan kyrka och stat. Även om lagen tillåter att vilken trosriktning som helst representeras i kaplanskapet, har kristna kaplaner i praktiken alltid haft den permanenta posten. Icke-kristna kaplaner har endast deltagit som gäster – vilket tyder på kvarstående sociala och institutionella preferenser. En Kaplan får inte vara en buddist, muslim eller hindu utan skall vara kristen. En Kaplan får inte vara en kvinna . Fullständig separation är därför svår att genomföra på grund av djupa historiska rötter, kulturella preferenser, majoritetens religiösa identitet och den symboliska betydelse som vissa traditioner har. Det skulle kräva både juridiska reformer och en förändring av offentliga värderingar. Denna ”ofullständiga separation” finns även i andra länder (som Sverige), där gamla band kvarstår trots reformer som syftar till att etablera neutralitet och jämlikhet mellan religioner. Fullständig separation innebär en regering som är neutral, sekulär och lika öppen för alla individer – oavsett religiös övertygelse – där religionen är helt privat och exkluderad från officiella statliga funktioner. Detta är en pågående process, inte bara en uppsättning policyer, och kräver både institutionell och kulturell omvandling. Om religiösa organisationer skulle få ett eget valsystem och ett eget parlament genom ett valsystem med flera religioner, Multireligionvalsystem, skulle det faktiskt skapa större sammanflätning mellan religion och politik, inte mer separation. Här är anledningen: Politisk makt för religioner: Att ge religiösa grupper befogenhet att välja representanter till ett separat religiöst parlament skulle formalisera religionens roll som politisk aktör och potentiellt ge den inflytande inom lagstiftande, politiska eller statliga frågor. Ett sådant separat religiöst parlament är The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Multireligionvalsystemet har tre huvuduppgifter att lösa nämligen:
<br>1) Den ofullbordade separationen  mellan stat och kyrka samt  mellan religion och politik.
<br>2) Införa demokati i alla religioner utan undantag som  börjar med de nordiska länderna som redan har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund genom kyrkovalet.
I de nordiska länderna bor judar, katoliker,  ortodoxa, muslimer m fl som inte har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund.
<br>3) Att lösa den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina .  <a href="https://fdu.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/israels-apartheid/" rel="dofollow">Besök israel</a>


<br>Att angripa problem 1 och 2 . <br>
Söndagen den  21 sep-2025 var det ett politiskt-religiöst val i Sverige men det är inte många med invandrarbakgrund som känner till det valet trots att alla riksdagspartier deltar i detta val  ; för det är hemligt. Varken demokratiministern, jämställdhetsministern ,riksdagspartierna , kyrkorna , trossamfund i allmänhet ,organisationer som ägnar sig åt demokrati  eller svensk media vill ta upp det .

Genom att riksdagspartierna och politiker, bl a en f d statsminister och partiledare, deltog i och nominerades i kyrkovalet i Sverige utgör ett hinder för att fullborda separationen  mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik.
EU-valet påverkas . Även inom katolska och ortodoxa medlemsländer i EU saknas motsvarande val som kyrkovalet . EU är indelat i länder som har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund som de protestantiska i Sverige, Danmark och Finland medan andra motsätter sig detta och t o m saknar kunskap om kyrkovalet.
De religiösa partierna och högerextrema blir fler och får finansieringsstöd  , bildar politiska allianser som påverkar politiken såsom inom EU , USA m f l .

<br>Problem 3: 3 <br> How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world,the Israel-Palestine conflict ?
Why did the Israeli terrorists assassinate Nobel Peace Prize winner Yitzhak Rabin when he participated in the peace agreement, the Oslo Accords! . Is that assassination different from non-peace prize winners like the assassination of Kennedy and Palme ?
Eftersom mordet på Nobel Peace Prize winner Yitzhak Rabin  som  är jude,  och Nobels fredspristagare, genomfördes av extrema judiska terrorister  kan konstateras att den 77 år långa konflikten är en religiös konflikt vid sidan av ockupation, bosättare och som utvecklats till folkmord på palestinier i Gaza.
Risken är att nästa fredsförhandlare också blir undanröjd av extremister och därför vill ingen riskera sitt liv  .  Konfliketen överlämnas till nästkommande generation med fortsatt dödande och fortsatt demolering av infrastruktur med mycket avancerade vapen som levereras från vapentillverkande länder , samt förstörelse av miljö , vatten och luft i Mellanöstern.
Detta problem angrips genom följande reform.
<br>We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception. A transition from church elections to a multi-religion election system in those countries that already have church elections, In other countries (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel.....) that do not have similar elections, a multi-religion election system is introduced. !
<br>The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System
<br>Multi-Religion Support - The financial model that replaces the SST Foundation and the corresponding party support, but regardless of tax revenue.
<br>Vapenindustrin (försvarsindustrin Elbit Systems Sweden - ett dotterbolag till det israeliska Elbit Systems  .Elbit Systems producerar drönare som används av IDF i Gaza  ) samt oljeindustrin som också är en ohållbar och miljöförstörande industri och därför måste den avvecklas på samma sätt som tobaksindustrin !<br>Democracy has long been the engine that<a href="https://community.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/2025/08/fortydligande-om-multireligionval-multi.html" title="fortydligande-om-multireligionval"> grants religious freedom</a>. Evolving from church-specific elections—like in Sweden—to <a href="https://blog.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/" title="Blog om Multireligionvalsystem">inclusive multi-religion election system</a>s can ensure that all faith and belief communities engage democratically. Embracing such a model would affirm democracy’s role not just in the state, but deeply within the world’s religious institutions.</p>

Trots bistånd till de fattiga länderna saknar många av dessa länder fortfarande &nbsp;en egen fungerande topdomän. Länder som är med i EU försummar betydelsen av sitt ccTLDs . En fungerande topdomän som .se vilar hela it-infrastrukturen på . Den skapar många arbetstillfällen . De flyktingar som saknar arbete kan starta ett eget it-bolag som kan få sina länders icke fungerande topdomän till sig själva och på det sättet lösa arbetslösheten bland den grupp flyktingar som finns då landet är i krig eller som av religiösa skäl inte vill ha ett fungerande internet .</p>

Den rättigheten skall uppmuntra dem till att arbeta för demokrati och att &nbsp;tillämpa den &nbsp;sinsemellan när de bildar en förening eller en partiorganisation som De Nya Svenskarna och sedan omsätta den i praktiken i sitt eget land vid återvändandet och återbyggandet.<br>De nya svenskarna började med att kalla folk till ett öppet möte , förde protokoll enligt dagordningen , valde styrelse och en kvinnlig partiledare . Partiet registrerades utan hinder och så småningom deltog vi valet , beställde valsedalar med kandidater , vi hade en valberedning och började värva medlemmar. Allt detta för att visa andra flyktingar som inte tror på demokrati att demokratin faktiskt fungerar men den behöver utvecklas även av oss .Vi finns på nästan alla sociala mediers plattformar och har många vänner där, solidaritet.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Ungdomsförbunden tillhörande de olika riksdagspartierna och lärarnas okunskap om de elever som tillhör olika religioner och deras rättigheter under valrörelsen 2022</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Om skolan skulle vara en byggsten i skapandet av ett demokratiskt samhälle vad är då anledningen till att gymnasielärarna, ungdomsförbunden och elevdemokratin saknar kunskap om grundläggande rättigheter gällande de elever med en annan tro än kristendom.</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Om det är demokratin som har givit alla trossamfund religionsfrihet , hur kommer det sig då att bara kristna protestantiska elever får praktisera demokrati två år innan det allmänna valet ?</p>
        <h3 class="blog-header sub-heading">Elevdemokratis roll&nbsp;</h3>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Varför undrar inte de elever vilka själva utövar demokrati genom elevdemokrati varför en del har rösträtt när de har fyllt 16 år och kan praktisera demokrati två år innan de får delta i det allmänna valet medan andra som sitter i samma klassrum saknar denna rättighet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">De elever som har denna rättighet kan nämligen avstå från attD rösta på samma sätt som deras föräldrar gjorde vid valet i september 2021. Emellertid saknar andra elever med en annan religion båda möjligheterna, de har varken rösträtt eller rätten att avstå att rösta på samma sätt som sina föräldrar som bekänner sig till en annan religion.</p>

        <p class="paragraph news-p">Hur kan det då komma sig att även ungdomsförbunden tillhörande de olika riksdagspartierna saknar kunskap och kännedom om de elever som inte har denna rättighet. Ungdomsförbunden undrar inte heller hur det kommer sig att deras riksdagspartier deltog i det valet utan att informera andra med en annan religion som kan vara medlemmar i samma parti eller rösta på det partiet.</p>
        <h3 class="blog-header sub-heading"><span class="heading-text-12">Återuppbyggande av demokratin</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Eftersom demokratiministern också saknar kunskap om skillnaden i tillämpning av demokratin som nämnts ovan, både bland elever inom de nordiska länderna och EU, förblir uttrycket ” skolan skulle vara en byggsten i skapandet av ett demokratisk samhälle” som bläck på papperet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Detta gör att demokratin aldrig kommer att utvecklas som i sin tur kommer att leda till ett minskat valdeltagande , misstro till demokratin och riksdagspartierna med dålig tillämpning av demokratin.</p><span class="glyph feature-icon"><i class="coffeecup-icons-leaf2"></i></span>

        <a class="link-text text-link-1" href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/Integration-and-Conflict">Att det redan finns ett religiöst kristet parti i riksdagen är ett annat demokratiproblem , liknande finns i Iran och Libanon fast med egna miliser. Riksdagen representerar alla medborgare oavsett religion. Därför heter det att makten utgår från folket.<br>
