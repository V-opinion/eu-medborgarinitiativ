  <!-- HOW IT WORKS TAB -->
  <section id="how" class="tab-content">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Mitt riksdagsparti  med studentförbund, ungdomsförbund och kvinnoförbund deltar i kyrkovalet men inte jag  , varför ?

Så motiverar förmodligen många  riksdagsledamöter  som tillhör riksdagspartierna, deras respektive ungdomsförbund m fl som inte deltar i kyrkovalet samtidigt som de inte undrar över med vilka pengar riksdagspartierna finansierar kyrkovalets valrörelse..

Socialdemokraterna , Moderaterna, Kristdemokraterna ,Sverigedemokraterna ,Liberalerna,
 Centerpartiet , Vänsterpartiet  och  Miljöpartiet


Varför håller riksdagsparterna fast vid den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik genom b l a kyrkovalet ?
De  349  riksdagsledamöterna  är indelade i ytterligare tre grupperingar
1) De som deltar ,  röstar i kyrkovalet  som får följa partilinjen
2) De som har lämnat svenska kyrkan och inte får rösta dvs inte får följa parti linjen .
3) De som har två valmöjligheter ,protestantiska riksdagsledamöter som deltar i kyrkovalet och har rösträtt som de kan avstå från, rösta eller avstå , följa eller inte följa partilinjren

Medan de  ledamöter i riksdagspartierna som tillhör ett annat trossamfund än protestantiska dvs buddist, hindu, jude , katolik eller muslim inte har samma rätt att följa sitt parti i kyrkovalets valrörelse, med bara en valmöjlighet d v s de får  inte delta.
De får heller inte veta varför deras parti deltar i ett religiöst kristet val  när kyrka och stat är separerade så även mellan religion och politik  .

Detta stora problem  uttnyttjas av två riksdaspartier SD och KD som  genom kyrkovalet och kyrkomötet bedriver en  häxjakt mot en av de största religionerna.

Problemet är varken RF , kontrollmakten KU , talmannen eller riksdagen  dessa 349 mandat som är delad i två klyftor , de ledamöter som har rösträtt i kyrkovalet, och de  ledamöter som tillhör ett annat trossamfund än protestantism och som inte har samma rätt. Inte ens vaför bara protestantiska trossamfund har gjort det möjligt att välja en  kvinnlig ärkebiskop men inte de andra
 vilket är ett. stort demokrati och jämställdhetsproblem.

Diskriminering från svenska kyrkan, riksdagspartierna eller talmannen som öppnar två parallella parlament , riksdagen och kyrkomötet som andra politiker tillhörande andra trossamfund inte får delta i.

Eller att dessa politiker förmodligen  inte har reflekterat  över att detta altenativ omedvetet har exkluderat dem själva och andra ungdomar från den rättigheten och därför saknar de denna rösträtt som gör att  riksdagen inte är  jämställd som folkets företrädare ur den synvinkel de har som saknar rösträtt.
Är inte medvetna om att den protestantiska kyrkan därför har infört demokrati i form av kyrkoval men inte andra trossamfund vars medlemmar har flytt från diktaturer och krig  .
Detta kan också bero på att de inte lyckats övertala sina religiösa ledare att det är demokratin som har givit de religionsfrihet och därför borde de arbeta för kyrkovalsreformen.
Alternativet är att de  är nöjda med att få vara lediga från riksdagen under
kyrkovalsrörelsen medan de andra ledamöterna som har rösträtt som har engagerat sig i något annat än vad det svenska folket egentligen har givit dem uppdrag för..

Och att trossamfund som är icke protestantiska är nöjda med statsbidrag som de får utan krav och att riksdagsledamöterna som  får röster från dessa trossamfund också är nöjda med att få statsbidrag.
Att samtliga trossamfund vill ha kvar den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik
Frågan  är om riksdagspartierna är eniga om
Att kyrkan och staten gick skilda vägar för 25 år sedan ,
Att religionen  inte skall blanda sig i politiken ,
Att politikerna endast skall ägna sig åt sitt uppdrag som de fick av svenska folket,
Att partistödet ges för att främja demokratin och det skall inte vara beroende av anonyma källor som påverkar deras politik och  att partistödet inte skall finansiera kyrkovalrörelsen
Att religionsfriheten är en grundbult i vår demokrati. Det innebär att demokratin har givit oss religionsfrihet .

Kyrkovalsreformen innebär att en övergång från kyrkoval till ett Multireligionvalsystem.
I de nordiska länderna som redan har kyrkoval och införande av Multireligionvalsystem inom EU och så småningom i övriga länder .

Genom detta uppfyller vi flera syfte b l a
En konfliktlhanteringsmodell gällande den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina.
Att fullborda separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik

Det som underlättar denna övergång är att de flesta nordiska länder redan har kyrkoval och att även de som fyllt 16 år har rösträtt och får praktisera demokrati två år innan riksdagsvalet .

      Hur kommer det sig att politiker med invandrarbakgrund är dåliga på att hävda sina egna och andras grundläggande rättigheter  ?

Att göra det möjligt för en politiker med invandrarbakgrund  att väljas till
statsministerposten  . Den posten förblir bokad för en svensk protestantisk politiker som har rösträtt och deltar eller följer partilinjen i kyrkovalet.

Att  t ex konvertera V:s partiledare eller L-ledaren Mohamsson till  kristendom, protestantism,  kan inte vara den enda vägen till att en politiker med invandrarbakgrund skall  få rätt att kunna bli vald till svensk statsminister .

Eller skall det ta lika lång tid som när de svenska kvinnorna som fick rösträtt 1921 och att det sedan dröjde över hundra år innan den första kvinnan  lyckades bli vald till statsminister  , hon heter Magdalena Andersson (S)  . Trots detta schabblade hon bort makten till SD efter ett kortvarigt mandat, cirka 7 månader. Ett stort bakslag  för svenska kvinnors kamp för jämställdhet särskilt vad gäller  kvinnor med invandrarbakgrund.
Varken manliga eller kvinnliga politiker med invandrarbakgrund  har lyckats med att åstadkomma en förändring . Detta kan bero på okunskap, detta  även när det gäller kyrkovalet.

Efter Branting tvingades S att dela på makten inom partiet, mellan Per Albin Hansson som fick statsministerposten och Richard Sandler som fick rollen som partiledare.
Jämställdhetsminister som motarbetar jämställdhet och  en demokratiminister som icke är  demokratisk.

1) Separera statsministerposten från rollen som partiledare.
2) Kyrkovalsreform
Den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik

Om de  gamla partierna som  MP , V och C får chansen att bilda en samlingsregering enligt principen att i kris bildas samlingsregering och i det här fallet  skall V, vars partiledare har invandrarbakgrund, erhålla statsministerposten.
Motiveringen är att S och Tidöpartiernas politik varit behäftad med många skandaler vid sidan av NATO krisen , anslutning utan föregående folkomröstning m m vilket har gjort Sverige svagt och impopulärt, även utomlands, samt en  sämre  tilltro till  Nobels priser då  två NATO- länder delar ut Nobelpriserna.
Denna handlingskraftiga samlingsregering skall också  vidta åtgärder mot den bristfälliga demokrati som tillämpas i de länder som påstår sig ha en fungerande demokrati, USA, EU , Israel      m fl   och som kan göra att  den 77 år långa konfliketn mellan Israel och Palestina  blir möjlig att lösa.

Låt inte Mos 12:1:  utnyttjas av kristna ytterhögerpartier och sionister  inom EU , Israel och USA  för att legitimera ockupation, bosättningar, pågående folkmord , mord på hittills
70 000 palestinier m.m , och kyrkovalet som utnyttjas av högerextremister för att kränka en av de största religionerna och som i sin tur utnyttjas för en ofullbordad separation mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik , där en f d statsminister tillika partiledare som uteslutit all politisk kunskap och  sin ideologi och i stället vänt sig till kyrkan där han  nominerades i kyrkovalet  sep 2025  .
Vapenindustrin (försvarsindustrin Elbit Systems Sweden - ett dotterbolag till det israeliska Elbit Systems  .Elbit Systems producerar drönare som används av IDF i Gaza  ) samt oljeindustrin som också är en ohållbar och miljöförstörande industri och därför måste den avvecklas på samma sätt som tobaksindustrin !  </p>

  <!-- War & Environment content here -->
  <h1>War, Environment, and Multi-Religion Democracy</h1>

  <p>
    War and environmental destruction are deeply connected. Every modern conflict harms the land, air, and water we all depend on.
    At the same time, environmental crises such as droughts, floods, and resource scarcity can push societies closer to conflict.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Multi-Religion Election System</strong> proposes a democratic way for faith communities to work together &mdash; not only
    to prevent war, but also to protect the environment that all believers share.
  </p>

  <h2>1. How war destroys the environment</h2>
  <p>
    War does not only kill people. It also kills ecosystems.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bombing and shelling destroy forests, farmland, riverbanks, and wildlife habitats.</li>
    <li>Oil fires, damaged industrial plants, and military waste poison soil and water for decades.</li>
    <li>Refugees are forced to survive in fragile landscapes, often cutting trees and overusing land simply to stay alive.</li>
    <li>Military spending absorbs resources that could be used for climate protection, clean energy, and sustainable development.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The damage is slow and often invisible in the beginning, but future generations inherit the poisoned land, the polluted rivers,
    and the lost biodiversity.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How environmental crises can fuel conflict</h2>
  <p>
    Environmental breakdown can also lead to new conflicts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Water shortages and failing harvests increase competition between groups, regions, and countries.</li>
    <li>Climate change makes droughts and floods more frequent, pushing people off their land.</li>
    <li>Scarcity of food and safe living space can turn existing tensions between religious or ethnic communities into open violence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In this way, war and environmental destruction form a vicious circle: war damages nature, and damaged nature makes new wars more likely.
  </p>

  <h2>3. A shared responsibility in all religions</h2>
  <p>
    Most religious traditions teach respect for creation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Earth is given as a trust, not as a private possession.</li>
    <li>Humans are called to be guardians, stewards, or caretakers of life.</li>
    <li>Waste, greed, and unnecessary destruction are seen as sins or moral failures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When different faiths meet only in conflict, this shared responsibility is forgotten. But when they meet in a democratic,
    respectful way, this common ground can become a powerful force for peace and environmental protection.
  </p>

  <h2>4. The Multi-Religion Election System as a peace and environment model</h2>
  <p>
    The Multi-Religion Election System offers a democratic framework where all major religious and life-stance communities can elect
    representatives to a common chamber.
  </p>
  <p>
    In such a chamber:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each tradition has a voice and a vote &mdash; no group is excluded.</li>
    <li>Decisions are made through dialogue, negotiation, and ballots instead of threats and weapons.</li>
    <li>Environmental protection can be treated as a <strong>moral and democratic obligation</strong> shared by all religions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This makes it possible to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agree on minimum environmental standards that all faith communities support.</li>
    <li>Issue joint declarations against wars that destroy people and nature.</li>
    <li>Support national and local policies that reduce emissions, protect forests and water, and care for the most vulnerable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. From church elections to multi-religion democracy</h2>
  <p>
    In countries that already have <strong>church elections</strong>, the Multi-Religion Election System proposes a transition:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>From single-religion elections to <strong>multi-religion elections</strong>,</li>
    <li>From one dominant church to a pluralistic democracy of many beliefs,</li>
    <li>From internal church power struggles to a shared responsibility for peace and the environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This transition can create a new political&ndash;spiritual institution where religious authority is linked to democratic
    accountability and ecological responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>6. A call to action</h2>
  <p>
    War and environmental collapse are not natural laws. They are the results of human decisions and institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Multi-Religion Election System invites:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Religious leaders who want to protect both people and the Earth,</li>
    <li>Youth who want a future without war and climate catastrophe,</li>
    <li>Citizens who believe that faith and democracy can work together for peace.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By giving all traditions a democratic voice, we can move away from holy wars and towards <strong>holy responsibility</strong> &mdash;
    for each other, and for the shared environment that sustains all life.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish to explore how this model could be applied in your country, community, or religious tradition, you are welcome to
    contact us and participate in the development of a truly multi-religion democracy.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p>
      How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world, The Israel-Palestine conflict by transition from the church election to a multi-religion  election system ? <br>
We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception. A transition from church elections to a multi-religion election system in those countries that already have church elections, In other countries (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel…..) that do not have similar elections, a multi-religion electoral system is introduced. !
The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System
– Multi-Religion Support – The financial model that replaces the SST Foundation and the corresponding party support, but regardless of tax revenue.

      <h2>Democracy and Religious Freedom</h2>
      <p>Democracy has historically spearheaded the expansion of <strong><a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/comparison/kyrkovalet-vs-Multireligionvalet.html" title="kyrkovalet vs Multireligionval">religious freedom</a></strong>, enabling diverse faith groups to practice openly and equally. Across nations, democratic ideals have been central to ensuring that no religious community is excluded from public life and governance.</p>

      <h2>Why Transition <a href="https://blog.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/topics/category/det-svenska-hemliga-valet/" title="det svenska hemliga valet">from Church Elections to Multi-Religion election Systems</a>?</h2>
      <p>In countries such as Sweden, the Church of Sweden has held democratic church elections since 2000. <a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/Nej-till-karnkraft/" title="Folkomröstning ">voting options</a>.
       Globally, most countries do not have similar mechanisms.<br>Den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt religion och politik då kristna EU- medborgare har egna kristna partier som representerar dessa religiöst i EU -parlamentet , medan andra EU-medborgare tillhörande någon annan religion saknar egna religiösa  partier och har därmed  ingen represntation i EU-parlamentet.

 <br>En exkluderingspolitik som grundar sig på en ofullbordad separation mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik .

<br>Därför är det utomordentligt viktigt att  arbeta för en fullbordad separation mellan stat och kyrka samt religion och politik . Denn reform är viktig för att kunna lösa den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina så att konflikten inte överlämnas till nästa generation.<br> A <strong><a href="https://a-multi-religion-election-system.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/" title="multireligionvalsystem">multi-religion election system</a></strong> would allow different faith communities to democratically select leadership, ensuring that democracy permeates every religious institution—Därför är det  nödvändigt att reformera kyrkovalet enligt principen.

<br>How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world, The Israel-Palestine conflict by transition from the church election to a multi-religion  election system ?
<br>We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception. A transition from church elections to a multi-religion election system in those countries that already have church elections, In other countries (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel…..) that do not have similar elections, a multi-religion electoral system is introduced. !
<br>The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System
– Multi-Religion Support – The financial model that replaces the SST Foundation and the corresponding party support, but regardless of tax revenue.
-------------------------------</p>

      <h2><a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/What-is-a-multi-religion-election-system.html" title="What is a multi- religion election system ?"><span style="color: #8BCC75">What Is a Multi-Religion Election System?</span></a></h2>
      <p>It is an inclusive voting framework where <a href="https://political-practices-in-exile.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/" title="How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world ?">all recognized religious communities participate in structured</a>, fair elections to choose their representatives or leaders. This could be implemented at local, national, or interfaith levels.<br>Mitt riksdagsparti  med studentförbund, ungdomsförbund och kvinnoförbund deltar i kyrkovalet men inte jag  , varför ?   <br>

Så motiverar förmodligen många  riksdagsledamöter  som tillhör riksdagspartierna, deras respektive ungdomsförbund m fl som inte deltar i kyrkovalet samtidigt som de inte undrar över med vilka pengar riksdagspartierna finansierar kyrkovalets valrörelse..

<br>Socialdemokraterna , Moderaterna, Kristdemokraterna ,Sverigedemokraterna ,Liberalerna,
 Centerpartiet , Vänsterpartiet  och  Miljöpartiet  <br>


Varför håller riksdagsparterna fast vid den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik genom b l a kyrkovalet ?  <br>
De  349  riksdagsledamöterna  är indelade i ytterligare tre grupperingar
<br>1) De som deltar ,  röstar i kyrkovalet  som får följa partilinjen
<br>2) De som har lämnat svenska kyrkan och inte får rösta dvs inte får följa parti linjen .
<br>3) De som har två valmöjligheter <a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/Nej-till-karnkraft/" title="Vad är Folkomröstning och hur ma upphäva den">,protestantiska riksdagsledamöter</a> som deltar i kyrkovalet och har rösträtt som de kan avstå från, rösta eller avstå , följa eller inte följa partilinjren

<br>Medan de  ledamöter i riksdagspartierna som tillhör ett annat trossamfund än protestantiska dvs buddist, hindu, jude , katolik eller muslim inte har samma rätt att följa sitt parti i kyrkovalets valrörelse, med bara en valmöjlighet d v s de får  inte delta.
De får heller inte veta varför deras parti deltar i ett religiöst kristet val  när kyrka och stat är separerade så även mellan religion och politik  .

<br>Detta stora problem  uttnyttjas av två riksdaspartier SD och KD som  genom kyrkovalet och kyrkomötet bedriver en  häxjakt mot en av de största religionerna.

Problemet är varken RF , kontrollmakten KU , talmannen eller riksdagen  dessa 349 mandat som är delad i två klyftor , de ledamöter som har rösträtt i kyrkovalet, och de  ledamöter som tillhör ett annat trossamfund än protestantism och som inte har samma rätt. Inte ens vaför bara protestantiska trossamfund har gjort det möjligt att välja en  kvinnlig ärkebiskop men inte de andra
 vilket är ett. stort demokrati och jämställdhetsproblem.<br>

<br>Diskriminering från svenska kyrkan, riksdagspartierna eller talmannen som öppnar två parallella parlament , riksdagen och kyrkomötet som andra politiker tillhörande andra trossamfund inte får delta i.

<br>Eller att dessa politiker förmodligen  inte har reflekterat  över att detta altenativ omedvetet har exkluderat dem själva och andra ungdomar från den rättigheten och därför saknar de denna rösträtt som gör att  riksdagen inte är  jämställd som folkets företrädare ur den synvinkel de har som saknar rösträtt.
<br>Är inte medvetna om att den protestantiska kyrkan därför har infört demokrati i form av kyrkoval men inte andra trossamfund vars medlemmar har flytt från diktaturer och krig  .
<br>Detta kan också bero på att de inte lyckats övertala sina religiösa ledare att det är demokratin som har givit de religionsfrihet och därför borde de arbeta för kyrkovalsreformen.
<br>Alternativet är att de  är nöjda med att få vara lediga från riksdagen under
kyrkovalsrörelsen medan de andra ledamöterna som har rösträtt som har engagerat sig i något annat än vad det svenska folket egentligen har givit dem uppdrag för..

Och att trossamfund som är icke protestantiska är nöjda med statsbidrag som de får utan krav och att riksdagsledamöterna som  får röster från dessa trossamfund också är nöjda med att få statsbidrag.
<br>Att samtliga trossamfund vill ha kvar den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik
<br>Frågan  är om riksdagspartierna är eniga om
<br>Att kyrkan och staten gick skilda vägar för 25 år sedan ,
<br>Att religionen  inte skall blanda sig i politiken ,
<br>Att politikerna endast skall ägna sig åt sitt uppdrag som de fick av svenska folket,
<br>Att partistödet ges för att främja demokratin och det skall inte vara beroende av anonyma källor som påverkar deras politik och  att partistödet inte skall finansiera kyrkovalrörelsen
<br>Att religionsfriheten är en grundbult i vår demokrati. Det innebär att demokratin har givit oss religionsfrihet .

<br>Kyrkovalsreformen innebär att en övergång från kyrkoval till ett Multireligionvalsystem.
I de nordiska länderna som redan har kyrkoval och införande av Multireligionvalsystem inom EU och så småningom i övriga länder .

<br>Genom detta uppfyller vi flera syfte b l a
En konfliktlhanteringsmodell gällande den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina.
Att fullborda separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik

<br>Det som underlättar denna övergång är att de flesta nordiska länder redan har kyrkoval och att även de som fyllt 16 år har rösträtt och får praktisera demokrati två år innan riksdagsvalet .
</p>
        Frågan är Varför politiker och fredspristagare undviker att återuppliva Osloavtalen – och varför det är vår uppgift att förhindra att Israel-Palestina-konflikten går vidare till en annan generation Vilket system är ett konflikthanteringssystem vad gäller bl a den mest komplicerade, Israel-Palestina-konflikten? Är det Kyrkovalsystemet , Kaplansystemet eller Multireligionvalsystemet ? Eftersom vare sig Kyrkovalet eller Kaplansystemet har lyckats med att lösa den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina och inte ens genom någon politisk ideologi, såsom Socialism, Konservatism, Liberalism eller Ecologism medan ett Multireligionvalsystem klarar av att hantera en sådan komplex och svårlöst konflikt som Israel-Palestina konflikten. .<br> Vad är en Kaplan ? <br>Kaplan är en präst med särskilt ansvar tex särskilt ansvar i USA:s kongress , i de nordiska länderna kan det vara en kyrkopolitiker som håller begravningstal . En kaplan i den amerikanska kongressen har historiskt sett alltid varit kristen (mestadels protestanter eller katoliker). <br>Valet av en kaplan beslutas av ledamöterna i varje kammare (representanthuset eller senaten). Det faktum att alla heltidsanställda kongresspräster i USA har varit kristna är ett exempel på hur separationen mellan kyrka och stat – och mellan religion och politik – inte är fullt ut förverkligad i praktiken. Den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik Själva kaplansämbetet är ett religiöst ämbete inom en sekulär regeringsstruktur. Även om det är avsett som ceremoniellt eller stödjande, är det ett synligt tecken på religion i politiken och den offentliga sfären. Kaplan : Lobbyverksamhet och opinionsbildning: Liksom andra intressegrupper kan religiösa organisationer lobba kongressledamöter, lämna in vittnesmål, förespråka för eller emot lagstiftning och delta i policydiskussioner. Detta görs externt, genom samma kanaler som fackföreningar, näringslivsgrupper eller ideella organisationer. De försöker övertyga lagstiftare, men de är inte en del av den lagstiftande makten. I den 119:e kongressen i USA (2025–2027) finns representation den överväldigande majoriteten är kristna.Kristna grupper: Protestantiska (metodister, baptister, presbyterianska, lutherska, episkopaliska, icke-konfessionella evangeliska m f l) Den fortsatta traditionen med enbart kristna kaplaner återspeglar en historisk kristen dominans i amerikansk regering och kultur. Den visar hur vissa religiösa symboler och sedvänjor fortfarande är sammanflätade med statliga institutioner, även i ett land som lagligen upprätthåller strikt separation mellan kyrka och stat. Även om lagen tillåter att vilken trosriktning som helst representeras i kaplanskapet, har kristna kaplaner i praktiken alltid haft den permanenta posten. Icke-kristna kaplaner har endast deltagit som gäster – vilket tyder på kvarstående sociala och institutionella preferenser. En Kaplan får inte vara en buddist, muslim eller hindu utan skall vara kristen. En Kaplan får inte vara en kvinna . Fullständig separation är därför svår att genomföra på grund av djupa historiska rötter, kulturella preferenser, majoritetens religiösa identitet och den symboliska betydelse som vissa traditioner har. Det skulle kräva både juridiska reformer och en förändring av offentliga värderingar. Denna ”ofullständiga separation” finns även i andra länder (som Sverige), där gamla band kvarstår trots reformer som syftar till att etablera neutralitet och jämlikhet mellan religioner. Fullständig separation innebär en regering som är neutral, sekulär och lika öppen för alla individer – oavsett religiös övertygelse – där religionen är helt privat och exkluderad från officiella statliga funktioner. Detta är en pågående process, inte bara en uppsättning policyer, och kräver både institutionell och kulturell omvandling. Om religiösa organisationer skulle få ett eget valsystem och ett eget parlament genom ett valsystem med flera religioner, Multireligionvalsystem, skulle det faktiskt skapa större sammanflätning mellan religion och politik, inte mer separation. Här är anledningen: Politisk makt för religioner: Att ge religiösa grupper befogenhet att välja representanter till ett separat religiöst parlament skulle formalisera religionens roll som politisk aktör och potentiellt ge den inflytande inom lagstiftande, politiska eller statliga frågor. Ett sådant separat religiöst parlament är The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Multireligionvalsystemet har tre huvuduppgifter att lösa nämligen:
<br>1) Den ofullbordade separationen  mellan stat och kyrka samt  mellan religion och politik.
<br>2) Införa demokati i alla religioner utan undantag som  börjar med de nordiska länderna som redan har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund genom kyrkovalet.
I de nordiska länderna bor judar, katoliker,  ortodoxa, muslimer m fl som inte har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund.
<br>3) Att lösa den 77 år långa konflikten mellan Israel och Palestina .  <a href="https://fdu.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/israels-apartheid/" rel="dofollow">Besök israel</a>


<br>Att angripa problem 1 och 2 . <br>
Söndagen den  21 sep-2025 var det ett politiskt-religiöst val i Sverige men det är inte många med invandrarbakgrund som känner till det valet trots att alla riksdagspartier deltar i detta val  ; för det är hemligt. Varken demokratiministern, jämställdhetsministern ,riksdagspartierna , kyrkorna , trossamfund i allmänhet ,organisationer som ägnar sig åt demokrati  eller svensk media vill ta upp det .

Genom att riksdagspartierna och politiker, bl a en f d statsminister och partiledare, deltog i och nominerades i kyrkovalet i Sverige utgör ett hinder för att fullborda separationen  mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik.
EU-valet påverkas . Även inom katolska och ortodoxa medlemsländer i EU saknas motsvarande val som kyrkovalet . EU är indelat i länder som har infört demokrati i sina trossamfund som de protestantiska i Sverige, Danmark och Finland medan andra motsätter sig detta och t o m saknar kunskap om kyrkovalet.
De religiösa partierna och högerextrema blir fler och får finansieringsstöd  , bildar politiska allianser som påverkar politiken såsom inom EU , USA m f l .

<br>Problem 3: 3 <br> How to solve a most complex and controversial issues in the world,the Israel-Palestine conflict ?
Why did the Israeli terrorists assassinate Nobel Peace Prize winner Yitzhak Rabin when he participated in the peace agreement, the Oslo Accords! . Is that assassination different from non-peace prize winners like the assassination of Kennedy and Palme ?
Eftersom mordet på Nobel Peace Prize winner Yitzhak Rabin  som  är jude,  och Nobels fredspristagare, genomfördes av extrema judiska terrorister  kan konstateras att den 77 år långa konflikten är en religiös konflikt vid sidan av ockupation, bosättare och som utvecklats till folkmord på palestinier i Gaza.
Risken är att nästa fredsförhandlare också blir undanröjd av extremister och därför vill ingen riskera sitt liv  .  Konfliketen överlämnas till nästkommande generation med fortsatt dödande och fortsatt demolering av infrastruktur med mycket avancerade vapen som levereras från vapentillverkande länder , samt förstörelse av miljö , vatten och luft i Mellanöstern.
Detta problem angrips genom följande reform.
<br>We start from the principle that it is democracy that has given all religious communities freedom of religion, and that democracy be introduced in all religions, without exception. A transition from church elections to a multi-religion election system in those countries that already have church elections, In other countries (USA, UK, China, India, Iran, Israel.....) that do not have similar elections, a multi-religion election system is introduced. !
<br>The Faith Representatives Chamber (FRC) , Trosrepresentanternas kammare, is free from the political parties and politicians and replaces the General Synod. The FRC is the highest body of all faiths, it is elected in Multi-Faith Elections. Multi-Religion Elections is the practical application of the Multi-Religion Election System
<br>Multi-Religion Support - The financial model that replaces the SST Foundation and the corresponding party support, but regardless of tax revenue.
<br>Vapenindustrin (försvarsindustrin Elbit Systems Sweden - ett dotterbolag till det israeliska Elbit Systems  .Elbit Systems producerar drönare som används av IDF i Gaza  ) samt oljeindustrin som också är en ohållbar och miljöförstörande industri och därför måste den avvecklas på samma sätt som tobaksindustrin !<br>Democracy has long been the engine that<a href="https://community.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/2025/08/fortydligande-om-multireligionval-multi.html" title="fortydligande-om-multireligionval"> grants religious freedom</a>. Evolving from church-specific elections—like in Sweden—to <a href="https://blog.multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/" title="Blog om Multireligionvalsystem">inclusive multi-religion election system</a>s can ensure that all faith and belief communities engage democratically. Embracing such a model would affirm democracy’s role not just in the state, but deeply within the world’s religious institutions.</p>

        <h4 class="team-name">Hur kommer det sig att politiker med invandrarbakgrund är dåliga på att hävda sina egna och andras grundläggande rättigheter  ?</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">Att göra det möjligt för en politiker med invandrarbakgrund  att väljas till
statsministerposten  . Den posten förblir bokad för en svensk protestantisk politiker som har rösträtt och deltar eller följer partilinjen i kyrkovalet.

Att  t ex konvertera V:s partiledare eller L-ledaren Mohamsson till  kristendom, protestantism,  kan inte vara den enda vägen till att en politiker med invandrarbakgrund skall  få rätt att kunna bli vald till svensk statsminister .

Eller skall det ta lika lång tid som när de svenska kvinnorna som fick rösträtt 1921 och att det sedan dröjde över hundra år innan den första kvinnan  lyckades bli vald till statsminister  , hon heter Magdalena Andersson (S)  . Trots detta schabblade hon bort makten till SD efter ett kortvarigt mandat, cirka 7 månader. Ett stort bakslag  för svenska kvinnors kamp för jämställdhet särskilt vad gäller  kvinnor med invandrarbakgrund.
Varken manliga eller kvinnliga politiker med invandrarbakgrund  har lyckats med att åstadkomma en förändring . Detta kan bero på okunskap, detta  även när det gäller kyrkovalet.

Efter Branting tvingades S att dela på makten inom partiet, mellan Per Albin Hansson som fick statsministerposten och Richard Sandler som fick rollen som partiledare.
Jämställdhetsminister som motarbetar jämställdhet och  en demokratiminister som icke är  demokratisk.

1) Separera statsministerposten från rollen som partiledare.
2) Kyrkovalsreform
Den ofullbordade separationen mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik

Om de  gamla partierna som  MP , V och C får chansen att bilda en samlingsregering enligt principen att i kris bildas samlingsregering och i det här fallet  skall V, vars partiledare har invandrarbakgrund, erhålla statsministerposten.
Motiveringen är att S och Tidöpartiernas politik varit behäftad med många skandaler vid sidan av NATO krisen , anslutning utan föregående folkomröstning m m vilket har gjort Sverige svagt och impopulärt, även utomlands, samt en  sämre  tilltro till  Nobels priser då  två NATO- länder delar ut Nobelpriserna.
Denna handlingskraftiga samlingsregering skall också  vidta åtgärder mot den bristfälliga demokrati som tillämpas i de länder som påstår sig ha en fungerande demokrati, USA, EU , Israel      m fl   och som kan göra att  den 77 år långa konfliketn mellan Israel och Palestina  blir möjlig att lösa.

Låt inte Mos 12:1:  utnyttjas av kristna ytterhögerpartier och sionister  inom EU , Israel och USA  för att legitimera ockupation, bosättningar, pågående folkmord , mord på hittills
70 000 palestinier m.m , och kyrkovalet som utnyttjas av högerextremister för att kränka en av de största religionerna och som i sin tur utnyttjas för en ofullbordad separation mellan stat och kyrka samt mellan religion och politik , där en f d statsminister tillika partiledare som uteslutit all politisk kunskap och  sin ideologi och i stället vänt sig till kyrkan där han  nominerades i kyrkovalet  sep 2025  .
Vapenindustrin (försvarsindustrin Elbit Systems Sweden - ett dotterbolag till det israeliska Elbit Systems  .Elbit Systems producerar drönare som används av IDF i Gaza  ) samt oljeindustrin som också är en ohållbar och miljöförstörande industri och därför måste den avvecklas på samma sätt som tobaksindustrin !</p>

Trots bistånd till de fattiga länderna saknar många av dessa länder fortfarande &nbsp;en egen fungerande topdomän. Länder som är med i EU försummar betydelsen av sitt ccTLDs . En fungerande topdomän som .se vilar hela it-infrastrukturen på . Den skapar många arbetstillfällen . De flyktingar som saknar arbete kan starta ett eget it-bolag som kan få sina länders icke fungerande topdomän till sig själva och på det sättet lösa arbetslösheten bland den grupp flyktingar som finns då landet är i krig eller som av religiösa skäl inte vill ha ett fungerande internet .</p>

Den rättigheten skall uppmuntra dem till att arbeta för demokrati och att &nbsp;tillämpa den &nbsp;sinsemellan när de bildar en förening eller en partiorganisation som De Nya Svenskarna och sedan omsätta den i praktiken i sitt eget land vid återvändandet och återbyggandet.<br>De nya svenskarna började med att kalla folk till ett öppet möte , förde protokoll enligt dagordningen , valde styrelse och en kvinnlig partiledare . Partiet registrerades utan hinder och så småningom deltog vi valet , beställde valsedalar med kandidater , vi hade en valberedning och började värva medlemmar. Allt detta för att visa andra flyktingar som inte tror på demokrati att demokratin faktiskt fungerar men den behöver utvecklas även av oss .Vi finns på nästan alla sociala mediers plattformar och har många vänner där, solidaritet.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Ungdomsförbunden tillhörande de olika riksdagspartierna och lärarnas okunskap om de elever som tillhör olika religioner och deras rättigheter under valrörelsen 2022</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Om skolan skulle vara en byggsten i skapandet av ett demokratiskt samhälle vad är då anledningen till att gymnasielärarna, ungdomsförbunden och elevdemokratin saknar kunskap om grundläggande rättigheter gällande de elever med en annan tro än kristendom.</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Om det är demokratin som har givit alla trossamfund religionsfrihet , hur kommer det sig då att bara kristna protestantiska elever får praktisera demokrati två år innan det allmänna valet ?</p>
        <h3 class="blog-header sub-heading">Elevdemokratis roll&nbsp;</h3>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Varför undrar inte de elever vilka själva utövar demokrati genom elevdemokrati varför en del har rösträtt när de har fyllt 16 år och kan praktisera demokrati två år innan de får delta i det allmänna valet medan andra som sitter i samma klassrum saknar denna rättighet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">De elever som har denna rättighet kan nämligen avstå från attD rösta på samma sätt som deras föräldrar gjorde vid valet i september 2021. Emellertid saknar andra elever med en annan religion båda möjligheterna, de har varken rösträtt eller rätten att avstå att rösta på samma sätt som sina föräldrar som bekänner sig till en annan religion.</p>

        <p class="paragraph news-p">Hur kan det då komma sig att även ungdomsförbunden tillhörande de olika riksdagspartierna saknar kunskap och kännedom om de elever som inte har denna rättighet. Ungdomsförbunden undrar inte heller hur det kommer sig att deras riksdagspartier deltog i det valet utan att informera andra med en annan religion som kan vara medlemmar i samma parti eller rösta på det partiet.</p>
        <h3 class="blog-header sub-heading"><span class="heading-text-12">Återuppbyggande av demokratin</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Eftersom demokratiministern också saknar kunskap om skillnaden i tillämpning av demokratin som nämnts ovan, både bland elever inom de nordiska länderna och EU, förblir uttrycket ” skolan skulle vara en byggsten i skapandet av ett demokratisk samhälle” som bläck på papperet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph news-p">Detta gör att demokratin aldrig kommer att utvecklas som i sin tur kommer att leda till ett minskat valdeltagande , misstro till demokratin och riksdagspartierna med dålig tillämpning av demokratin.</p><span class="glyph feature-icon"><i class="coffeecup-icons-leaf2"></i></span>

        <a class="link-text text-link-1" href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/Integration-and-Conflict">Att det redan finns ett religiöst kristet parti i riksdagen är ett annat demokratiproblem , liknande finns i Iran och Libanon fast med egna miliser. Riksdagen representerar alla medborgare oavsett religion. Därför heter det att makten utgår från folket.<br>
