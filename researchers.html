        <h1>Multireligion Electoral System – For Researchers</h1>
        <p>
            This page introduces the Multireligion Electoral System as a
            research-oriented framework at the intersection of religion, democracy and
            conflict resolution.

        <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Multireligion Electoral System is a normative and
            institutionally-oriented model designed for religiously diverse societies
            where the separation between state and religion remains incomplete. It
            asks how electoral systems and representative institutions can be
            structured to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mitigate religiously framed political conflicts</li>
            <li>Protect minority communities and non-believers</li>
            <li>Prevent structural domination by any single religious tradition</li>
            <li>Strengthen democratic legitimacy and trust in public institutions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The model is intended as a flexible framework, not a single fixed
            blueprint. It can therefore be adapted to different constitutional,
            historical and cultural contexts.

        <h2>Theoretical Foundations</h2>
        <p>
            The Multireligion Electoral System engages with several established
            research traditions, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Consociationalism and power-sharing</strong> in deeply divided
                societies
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Electoral system design</strong> (proportional representation,
                mixed systems, reserved seats and quotas)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Religion and politics</strong>, including state–religion
                relations and models of secularism
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Conflict resolution and peacebuilding</strong> in
                ethnoreligiously diverse contexts
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Human rights and constitutional law</strong>, especially freedom
                of religion and non-discrimination
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The aim is to integrate insights from these fields into a coherent
            framework that can guide both empirical analysis and institutional
            innovation.

    <section id="research-questions">
        <h2>Core Research Questions</h2>
        <p>
            The Multireligion Electoral System raises a number of questions that may
            be of interest to scholars in political science, law, religious studies
            and peace research, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Under what conditions do existing electoral systems intensify or
                moderate religious cleavages?
            </li>
            <li>
                How can representation mechanisms acknowledge religious identities
                without entrenching permanent sectarian divisions?
            </li>
            <li>
                What forms of power-sharing or guaranteed representation are compatible
                with liberal-democratic principles and individual rights?
            </li>
            <li>
                How do different models of state–religion relations affect the design
                and functioning of electoral institutions?
            </li>
            <li>
                In what ways can electoral engineering contribute to long-term
                peacebuilding and sustainable development in multireligious societies?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodological Approaches</h2>
        <p>
            Research on the Multireligion Electoral System can make use of a variety
            of methodological approaches, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Comparative case studies</strong> of states with strong
                religion–politics linkages
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Normative and conceptual analysis</strong> of legitimacy,
                equality and religious freedom
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Constitutional and legal analysis</strong> of electoral laws and
                state–religion arrangements
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scenario-building and institutional design</strong> (e.g.,
                simulation of alternative electoral rules)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Qualitative fieldwork</strong> with religious communities,
                political actors and civil society organizations
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Interdisciplinary collaboration is particularly encouraged, as the
            questions involved span law, political science, theology, sociology and
            peace studies.
